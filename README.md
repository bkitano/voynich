# Voynich Project

Yo welcome to my Voynich Project my name is Brian I'm 19 and I never fuckin learned how to read

## Installation (for C9)

I use C9. It's dope. It's sometimes hard to install stuff. You will need the following stuff 
for this to work.

1. nltk (NLP program) `conda install nltk`
2. BeautifulSoup (web scraper) `pip install beautifulsoup4`
3. matplotlib (graphing) `conda install matplotlib`
4. numpy (matrix stuff) `conda install numpy`

You will need to download the following files (use `curl -O`):
1. [Enhanced Voynich Dataset](http://www.voynichese.com/1/data/folio/voynichese_data.zip)
2. [Moby Dick from Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/old/moby10b.txt)

To unzip files, use `unzip` from the command line.
