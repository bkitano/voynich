# Voynich Project

Yo welcome to my Voynich Project my name is Brian I'm 19 and I never fuckin learned how to read

## Installation (for C9)

I use C9. It's dope. It's sometimes hard to install stuff. You will need the following stuff 
for this to work.

1. nltk (NLP program)
2. BeautifulSoup (web scraper)
3. matplotlib (graphing)
4. numpy (matrix stuff)

You will need to download the following files (use `curl -O`):
1. [Enhanced Voynich Dataset](http://www.voynichese.com/1/data/folio/voynichese_data.zip)
2. [Moby Dick from Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/old/moby10b.txt)

To unzip files, use `unzip` from the command line.
