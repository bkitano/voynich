Community Code on Visas (debate) The next item is the report by Henrik Lax, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on Visas - C6-0254/2006 -.
Thank you, Sarah, for your close cooperation. (SV) This proposed regulation should be established by means of the codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council.
The fact that the visa fee could not be reduced from EUR 60 to EUR 35 is disappointing.
However, this disappointment is assuaged by the fact, for example, that children under the age of six and persons under the age of 25 representing organisations in seminars, sports activities or cultural events will receive their visa free of charge.
I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Lax for his commitment and his excellent cooperation over the last three years on this very complex dossier, which puts European visa policy on a new footing.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lax for the exceptional work that he has undertaken.
Unfortunately, the visa fee will be EUR 60 instead of the EUR 35 suggested by Parliament.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Lax, for his work.
Regrettably, however, the visa fee is unchanged at EUR 60.
I would like to add that obviously we also have a strategy aimed at facilitating the obtaining of visas with a number of countries, and I am placing a great deal of hope in the development of this strategy in order to facilitate the granting of visas as far as possible, in particular to young people from third countries, because I think that we have every interest in facilitating the entry of young people into Europe.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 2 April 2009.
