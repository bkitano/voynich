Sector of berries and cherries intended for processing (debate) The next item is the oral question by Mr Daul and Mr Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on the situation of the sector of soft fruits and cherries intended for processing - B6-0435/2006).
At the same time, the European Commission started work on simplifying the common market in fruit and vegetables in the EU, on which it reported in August 2004.
Regarding the second point, the issue of the low level of organisation in new Member States will be considered in the framework of preparations for the proposal on reforming the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables.
The draft resolution contains actions that will satisfy our farmers and bring about stabilisation of the soft fruit market, which is very important for the future of this important sector.
I will inform my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, about the concerns you have raised.
Mr Siekierski, you were asking about support schemes for grouping producers: these exist both in the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables and in rural development legislation.
The debate is closed.
