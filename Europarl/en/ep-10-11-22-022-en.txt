Public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system (short presentation) The next item is the report by Ivo Belet, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system.
It is time that we, as the European Parliament, reminded all 27 Member States that they made those commitments back then and that they also have to keep to them.
This problem is dealt with by item 33 of the report. (SK) Madam President, I would like to begin by supporting the efforts of the rapporteur to launch a debate in the European Parliament on the media environment.
This was acknowledged in the revised communication from the Commission of 2009 on the application of State aid rules to public service broadcasting.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 November 2010.
