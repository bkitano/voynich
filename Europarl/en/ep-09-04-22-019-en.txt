Something will have to happen, however, and we will need to get things moving.
Many of the things included in the action plan are projects which are already underway.
We have experienced some difference of opinion as to what extent we should focus on modal alternatives to road transport, but I think that we have struck a balance between ensuring use of ITS technology in road transport and its interface with other modes of transport.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been following the ITS plan as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.
I would like to thank all those who have contributed their work and ideas.
They also support co-modality, including by developing interfaces with other modes of transport such as rail, waterways and aviation, which started to incorporate intelligent transport systems a long time ago.
However, I do think that we need to add some intelligence to all modes of transport.
To conclude, I believe that priority must also be given to modes of transport other than cars.
In particular, they deal with the use of ITS for the safety of users, as for example in the case of intelligent signs for the visually impaired.
We understand this to amount to some EUR 300 million, much of which will be channelled into EasyWay - first and foremost by the Commission.
