As we are assembled in Strasbourg, I would like to pay tribute to Pierre Pflimlin, who was Prime Minister of France, President of the European Parliament and Mayor of Strasbourg for many years.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you once again, on behalf of the European Parliament, for this invitation, for you demonstrated not only your commitment to Europe but also - and most importantly - you expressed, in that invitation, your appreciation of the European Parliament as the body representing the people of the European Union. (Applause) Mr President, on 2 July, a few weeks after your election, you addressed the people of Strasbourg and you said the following: 'I want France to take the responsibility that is its own, and I want all Europeans to become aware of their own responsibility to history.
I believe that Europe must be as democratic as possible.
The simplified Treaty resolves the institutional crisis, but the simplified Treaty does not resolve either the political crisis or the moral crisis in Europe.
In European democracy we should be able to discuss Europe's aims and objectives.
In European democracy we should be able to debate European identity and national identities.
It is a crisis that affects both our nations and the idea of civilisation that is shared by all Europeans and that unites Europe.
It is a crisis that is linked to globalisation and the commercialisation of the world.
Nothing will prevent me from achieving this objective and it is the best thing that France can do for Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this city of Strasbourg, so dear to the people of France and irrevocably linked in the minds of all Europeans to your Assembly, your Parliament, which keeps democratic debate so alive, here at this podium where she spoke so often, I remember Simone Veil, who in 1979 was the first President of the first directly-elected European Parliamentary Assembly.
