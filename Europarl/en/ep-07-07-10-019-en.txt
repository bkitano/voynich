The rules proposed in Article 13 are too strict and do not take into consideration certain characteristics of the air transport industry, especially its seasonality.
It seeks, in fact, to modernise and complete the 1992 regulation that set up the single aviation market in Europe.
Since full liberalisation in 1997, the number of routes has increased by more than 60%; more cities are served, notably in the isolated regions.
The text has been clarified, ambiguities have been removed and three regulations have been consolidated into a single text.
At present there are divergences between Member States in the application of the third package.
Thanks to this revision, we shall have a more uniform application especially in relation to the granting and overseeing of operating licences.
Consequently, this updated version should further strengthen the appeal of the single European market in many third countries.
Amendment 48 lays down that duties and charges must be listed and summarised in four categories: firstly, taxes and other State charges and duties; secondly, air traffic control charges; thirdly, charges, duties, fees and other costs for the benefit of the airlines; and, fourthly, fees, levies, charges and other costs for the benefit of the airport operators.
Despite this amendment, the compromise reached fully meets the transparency requirement, whilst taking into account the interests of passengers and also airlines, and so I and my group cannot support the rapporteur's new amendments, Amendments 54 and 55.
As regards the proposed amendments, we agree with all of them apart from Nos. 16, 29, 37, 40, 42, 49 and 50.
Mrs Jeggle, with regard to advertising on the Internet, I agree with you, but Amendment 48 seems to us very complicated.
Finally, for reasons of fair competition with third countries, I consider it is justified to compensate for the removal of Article 23 on price leadership by the possibility of imposing restrictions, when a third country with which an agreement has been signed does not recognise the same duties.
I thank Parliament also for having supported the Commission's approach concerning relations with third countries, which must be conducted in a coordinated fashion.
The Commission can accept in principle the following amendments: 1, 8, 10, 12, 20, 23, 31, 32, 36, 44 and 49.
The Commission can accept in part the following amendments: 33, 45 and 47.
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 2, 15, 16, 17, 25, 35, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48, 50, 57, 58, 59, 60 and 61.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 11 July 2007.
