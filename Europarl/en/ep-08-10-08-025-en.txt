The Arctic is different.
The effects of climate change are appearing more quickly and on a larger scale in the Arctic region than anywhere else in the world.
The Arctic, including the Barents Sea region, was recognised as a key area in the 2006 guidance document on the Northern Dimension, adopted in consultation with Russia, Norway and Iceland.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for initiating this debate and resolution.
Mr President, as we are all aware, surely, although we have some information about the Arctic, overall it is still terra incognita, in the truest sense of the word, as far as international law goes.
However, it is also clear that some proposals are complicated and that the general situation in the Arctic is very complicated, from the perspective of both the European Union and international law.
