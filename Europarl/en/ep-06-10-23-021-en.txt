Mr President, over recent years we have experienced a tsunami, hurricane Katrina and earthquakes in Pakistan and Indonesia with high death tolls, while in the European Union the Member States have frequently faced major floods and storms, forest fires, disasters at sea and industrial accidents.
The second weakness relates to the development of a European rapid response capability.
In its communication on 25 April, the Commission proposed the creation of special standby modules which would be mobilised on request by the competent European authority.
Finally, I should like to mention the Barnier report on the creation of Europe Aid.
Congratulations, Mr Papadimoulis.
Although responsibility for managing the response to natural disasters rests primarily with the country affected, with the Union playing a supporting role, the Community civil protection mechanism set up in 2001 lacked resources and powers.
The next stage is dealing with the fallout, and a crisis response instrument - in the shape of the Solidarity Fund - has already been put in place by the European Union in order to do this.
Now, as far as the amendments are concerned, the European Parliament has presented a series of important amendments with a view to strengthening civil protection capabilities at European level.
