It is left to the reader's imagination as to whether we now have 39 plus 11 posts or 43 plus 11 plus 39, or whether the 39 posts of 43 staff are listed and the 11 are then added.
The five executive agencies have 176 posts.
This amendment, in line with Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, was the joint work of the associated committee and the Committee on Budgets.
