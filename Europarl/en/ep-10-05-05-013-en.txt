In accordance with our Rules of Procedure and the Financial Regulation, discharge must be granted before 15 May of year n + 2.
The next plenary sitting apart from tomorrow's is not until 17 May, so if we do not vote now we shall be in contravention of our own Financial Regulation, which I think would be a sign of extremely poor management.
