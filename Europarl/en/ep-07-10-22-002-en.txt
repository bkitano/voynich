The signing of the Treaty will take place in Lisbon on 13 December, and on the previous day - the twelfth of December, as agreed with the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission - we shall proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at a formal sitting here in Strasbourg.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the work of our three representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference - Elmar Brok, Enrique Barón Crespo and Andrew Duff. (Applause) I am pleased to see that Enrique Barón Crespo is with us, but I cannot see the other representatives.
