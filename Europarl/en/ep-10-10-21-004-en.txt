Containers lost at sea and compensation (debate) The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on containers lost at sea and compensation by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism - B7-0469/2010).
It is estimated that a staggering 10 000 containers are lost at sea each year.
In European waters, 2 000 containers a year are lost at sea, and this figure would appear to be rising year on year.
Losing 20 000 of them a year is unacceptable.
As has been said, this concerns as many as 2 000 containers a year in European waters alone, with all the consequences for the environment, consequences possibly for the crews, for other ships and for the coastal regions, which of course are fairly often left with the task of clearing up the debris.
The operator, the shipping company and the crew in particular are responsible for the security of goods at sea.
They are now travelling at speeds of 27 knots, which is a huge speed in terms of the possibility of crashes or impacts, collisions and so on.
Hence, I believe the European Commission must strive to create an insurance fund that can provide compensation for any damage caused by the leakage of what are at times hazardous substances from containers lost at sea.
Commissioner, if I drop 2 000 heavy metal boxes into the sea, deliberately, with a load of materials in, then I would be prosecuted.
On 8 February this year, ferries sailing from Poland to Sweden were in immediate danger.
The Finnish freight vessel the Linda was sailing from Rotterdam to St Petersburg, and while crossing lanes used by Polish and Swedish vessels it lost three containers containing 8.3 tonnes of substances classified as dangerous to the environment, 7 tonnes of products which are hazardous to marine life and 5.5 tonnes of flammable substances.
