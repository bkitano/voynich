on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can do no other than extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs BudreikaitÄ—, for a successful job of work, and for a very balanced report that does not give rise to contention.
In this report, we are again calling on the United States, but also on India and China, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and to join with the European Union in taking responsibility for sustainable development worldwide.
