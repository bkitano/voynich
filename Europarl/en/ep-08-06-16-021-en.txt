on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, recitals A and D and paragraph 4 of this resolution clearly stress the value of prevention.
For this reason, before the summer and the outbreak of fires, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requested in its oral question that we hold a debate here with the Commission on what was being done to prevent fires.
Unfortunately, until further notice we only have the old Fund, which has been in existence in its present form since September 2002 and which was cobbled together hurriedly at the time.
As for the directive on forest fires, my departments are working on a communication on disaster prevention, and one option to be assessed is to institute legislation specifically on forest fires.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 June 2008.
