Report on Competition Policy 2008 (short presentation) The next item is the report by Sophia in 't Veld, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy, on competition policy 2008 - rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioners, dear colleagues - also those who are leaving the room right now - this report was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and it is the fruit of a joint effort of all political groups.
ECON welcomes, in particular, the emphasis on consumers.
I am therefore pleased that ECON urges the Commission to do a thorough evaluation of the results of the exceptional State aid operation.
We also need clarity, Commissioner, about the impact of the State aid exercise in the financial sector and, in particular, its possible distortive effects.
The European Commission previously committed to closely involving the European Parliament in the review process.
Mr President, naturally, I would like to thank Mrs in 't Veld on behalf of my colleague and friend, Mr Almunia, for her report on competition policy 2008.
The Commission, like Parliament, does not believe that the current economic crisis can justify relaxing competition rules on the control of concentrations or on State aid.
The key chapter of this 2009 report will be dedicated to competition in the context of this economic and financial crisis.
Mrs in 't Veld, in your speech, you also highlighted the issue of vertical restrictions, your proposed amendment.
As a result, the price differential between cattle in Ireland and in Britain is anything between EUR 150 to EUR 200 a head.
