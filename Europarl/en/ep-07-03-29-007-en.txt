Verification of the credentials of the new Members of the European Parliament (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say straight away that at the meetings of 26 and 27 February and 19 and 20 March, the Committee on Legal Affairs carried out the verification of the credentials of 56 Members, whose names appear in the annex to the Minutes.
The procedure for verification of credentials applies to the 18 Members designated by Bulgaria and the 35 Members designated by Romania.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has therefore approved a total of 56 mandates.
