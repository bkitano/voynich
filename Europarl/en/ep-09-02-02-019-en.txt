General and business aviation (short presentation) - The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on an agenda for sustainable future in general and business aviation.
Directly or indirectly, it generates 154 000 jobs across Europe.
Together with general aviation, where it is calculated that there are between 30 000 and 50 000 aircraft, the sector represents around 9% of all recorded air traffic and boasts the fastest growth in Europe, twice as high as that of all other traffic.
The second point relates to the application of the principle of proportionality in regulating the sector.
I therefore thank Luís Queiró for taking the trouble to prepare the report on this subject.
We should be aware that in Europe about 50 000 aircraft are in use in general and business aviation, and almost four times as many small aircraft and gliders are used for sport and recreation.
