a.m.) Mr President, on a point of order, I rise to inquire about the potential use of Rule 147 of our Rules of Procedure, following the disgraceful events of yesterday where some of our colleagues behaved, frankly, like hooligans.
Thank you, Mr Daul.
We will act exactly as laid down in Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure and will certainly be consistent with it.
