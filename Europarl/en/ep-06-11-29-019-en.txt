The placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles (debate) The next item is the report by Mr Joel Hasse Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles - C6-0312/2005 -.
The directive is urgently awaited in particular by the automobile supply industry and by consumer protection organisations.
It does not make sense for 27 Member States to prescribe different technical regulations for pyrotechnic articles, while their citizens within a Europe of open borders can easily shop for fireworks in neighbouring countries.
This concerns in particular fireworks in categories 2 and 3, which can pose somewhat higher risks.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude to the rapporteur for his constructive cooperation.
This directive draws together the 25 different sets of legislation governing explosives within the European Union.
