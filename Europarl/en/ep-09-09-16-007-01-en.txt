The Council of Europe has nominated José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission.
As usual, in the vote you may vote for or against the candidate, or abstain. (The vote is held) Here are the results of the vote: 718 Members voted, 382 in favour, 219 against and 117 abstentions. (Loud applause) According to the results we will see on the board - they are not visible yet - the Council's nominee, José Manuel Barroso, has been elected President of the European Commission.
I would like to thank Portugal for its support, which was also passed on to me by the President of the Republic, Professor Cavaco Silva.
