Quorum (continuation) At the start of the sitting this afternoon, therefore, I asked the opinion of at least one representative per group, as I had received a request for the quorum to be established in accordance with Rule 149 of our Rules of Procedure.
In fact, to be entirely honest, 39 + 1, because the eleventh name on the list is completely illegible.
