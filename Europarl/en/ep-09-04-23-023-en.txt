on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, as Socialists we fully support this report and contributed to it because we believe it is the first time in this Parliament that the political, legal and moral debate surrounding ethnic profiling and its effects on ordinary people has been raised properly.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Sarah Ludford for her report.
The report should have been even stronger, but it represents progress in the debate on this subject.
I would like to push the Commission a little bit further, though, on focusing on the specific problems of profiling.
