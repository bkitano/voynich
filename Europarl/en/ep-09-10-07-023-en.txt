For various reasons, this Statute did not enter into force in this form until 8 October 2004.
The date I mentioned, 8 October 2004, was almost exactly five years ago.
The report will contain an analysis of the four amendment alternatives specifically provided for by Article 69 of the Regulation and, at this stage, the Commission has not yet adopted a position either on this or on any other possible changes to the statute.
It is true that the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company is supplemented by a Directive on the involvement of employees and that the deadline for its transposition expired on 8 October 2004, the date on which the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company entered into force.
The idea has evolved, however, towards including small and medium-sized enterprises in the framework of the European company, the fruit of which is the Commission's proposal of March 2008 for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European private company.
