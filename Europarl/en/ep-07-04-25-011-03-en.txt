Community vessel traffic monitoring (vote) - Sterckx report - Before the vote on Amendment 46 (ES) I shall briefly explain the reason for the oral amendment.
We have come to an agreement and taken the view that the best solution is an oral amendment to Amendment 46 that I propose to the House and which consists of a simple addition, as follows: 'and in any case not later than 1 July 2008'.
