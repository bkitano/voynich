Your tireless and passionate commitment to the values that the United Nations and the European Union have in common is very important for us.
I myself have come because you are the democratic voice of the European people, that is, almost 500 million people.
You are a powerful vehicle for peace, stability and prosperity in your own region.
This year alone, an additional 64 million people will fall into extreme poverty.
We can save the lives of more than 16 million women and children.
Thank you for your resolution of April 2009 which supported total nuclear disarmament and cited the proposal for a Nuclear Weapons Convention.
The world cannot afford a Europe that does this. (FR) Modern Europe is founded on human rights and on the fundamental values of humanity.
Mr Secretary-General, thank you for your very encouraging words, such as the European Union having leadership, our solidarity, and also being a locomotive of our global train.
Thank you very much once again. (Applause) (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, several hours ago, a brutal terrorist attack was made on one of my party's offices in Poland.
