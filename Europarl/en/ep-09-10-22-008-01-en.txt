Draft general budget of the European Union - 2010 financial year (vote) - Before the vote: rapporteur. - Mr President, in the Committee on Budgets, we voted on more than 1 100 amendments to the 2010 draft budget.
Regarding the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Committee adopted two new paragraphs to be added to budget lines 06 04 14 01, 06 04 14 02 and 06 04 14 03.
Amendment 832 should, therefore, be adjusted accordingly.
After verification of the margins, the vote in committee left a margin of EUR 1 775 000 in Heading 3b.
This would mean that Amendment 889 on budget line 15 06 66 should be modified to give total commitment appropriations of EUR 32 255 000 and the retabled Amendment 547 is therefore covered.
The words 'sustainable and environmentally-friendly actions ... (Green New Deal)' should be added to the remarks instead of the words 'Green New Deal' in the remarks adopted on the following budget lines: 04 02 17 ESF - Convergence 04 02 19 ESF - Competitiveness 13 03 16 ERDF - Convergence 13 03 18 ERDF - Competitiveness Similarly, on the budget line 13 03 20 ERDF - Operational technical assistance for the European Regional Development Fund, the first two new paragraphs should be replaced by the following: 'Part of the appropriation is intended for financing sustainable and environmentally-friendly actions (Green New Deal) that provide for reconciling economic, social and environmental development requirements and for recovery of European regions after the economic and financial crisis'.
The budget line number of the Pilot Project on an all-inclusive cooperation between public authorities, commercial firms and not-for-profit enterprises on integrating people into society and employment should be changed to another line, 04 03 12, for technical reasons.
The budget line number of 'Preparatory Action - Erasmus for journalists' should be changed to 09 06 05 for technical reasons.
If Amendment 943 on the EPSO budget line 26 01 20 is adopted, the corresponding budgetary annex for this Office should be adjusted accordingly.
We have slightly different views but this is normal. (Applause) Mr President, according to the voting lists, Amendment 464 from the Green/EFA Group will fall if Amendment 870 from the Committee on Budgets is adopted.
As Amendment 464 only proposes to place funds in the reserve, it definitely cannot pose a problem of exceeding the limits.
I must inform the plenary that if we vote first on the Committee on Budgets amendments, which were not questioned by the Verts/ALE Group, then their subsequent amendment will decrease the European Regional Development Fund by EUR 300 million in payments.
We should stick to our decision, for it is written clearly in Amendment 464 that the payment is not increased.
Therefore, it is in conflict - there cannot be an increase of EUR 300 million and, at the same time, no increase. (...) so that we may proceed to the vote.
I therefore propose that we proceed to the vote. - Before the vote on Amendment 812: (PT) Mr President, I should like to ask for the floor pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure, which deals with failure to respect the Rules of Procedure.
I would like to ask for an amendment to the order of voting, since it seems to me that the order according to the voting list violates Rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure.
I therefore ask that Amendment 70, which proposes an appropriation of EUR 600 million to support the milk sector, which is facing an extremely serious situation, as we all know, be voted on immediately before Amendment 812, which proposes an appropriation of 300 million.
I would point out that this appropriation of EUR 600 million was unanimously approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and won broadly majority support in this House, in the last sitting on 17 September, when we voted on a resolution on supporting the milk sector and the crisis it is facing.
If, however, this is merely an argument about procedure, the vote in favour of Amendment 812 did not necessarily imply that Amendment 70 had lapsed.
Thank you. - Before the vote on Amendment 937: Mr President, I rise very quickly and on a point of order.
