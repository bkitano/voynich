This makes Korea one of our most important export markets in Asia.
We should remember the significant Korean investment in the car sector in Europe.
Mr President, South Korea is the EU's fourth largest external trading partner, with an export volume of around EUR 30 billion a year.
I hope, in any case, that this evening's debate will make it possible at last to address the many concerns regarding the impact of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea and, in particular, on European industry.
I will cite just one example to illustrate our fears.
As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry - in particular, in the car industry.
There are trade agreements with countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Japan and South Africa.
In Europe, there are trade agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Liechtenstein.
Britain on its own is the largest single trading partner with the EU with a GBP 40 billion deficit a year.
Clearly, in any free trade agreement - by definition - and in any negotiation, there are winners and losers, but if you look at the global impact of this agreement, there are big winners in Europe and there are big winners in Korea.
We have to remember, however, that today we have also just had a very serious discussion about the crisis in Europe's car industry, and this week we will also be dealing with problems in the textile industry and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid as compensation for the massive layoffs in that sector in Spain and Portugal.
That, in the end, is what we set out to do, and that, in the end, is what we have achieved.
The Commission therefore has a duty, from today, to review the terms of this agreement so as to restore the conditions of fair and equitable competition and to ensure the long-term survival of our industry and our jobs in Europe.
