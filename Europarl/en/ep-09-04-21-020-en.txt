Community framework for nuclear safety (debate) The next item is the report by Mr HÃ¶kmark, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council directive (Euratom) setting up a Community framework for nuclear safety - C6-0026/2009 -.
It is from this perspective that I would like to present this report on the Community framework for nuclear safety.
As the use of nuclear energy in the European Union is a reality and will be a reality, and nuclear safety is not constrained by national borders, we need a Community-wide framework aiming at achieving, maintaining and continuously improving nuclear safety in the European Union.
The revised proposal takes into account the outcome of a consultation process that started in 2004 with the Council's Working Party on Nuclear Safety.
It also reflects the substance of the opinion given by the Scientific Group of Experts, referred to in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, and the current nuclear safety proposal is a second revision of the regional proposal in the area of nuclear safety.
Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty does not require a resubmission of the revised proposal to the Scientific Group of Experts.
It is also a smart decision for Parliament to contribute to harmonisation in Europe and to establishing more security rules.
Finally, I am satisfied that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has accepted an amendment to the legislative resolution calling on the European Commission to consult the group of experts, in accordance with Article 31 of the Treaty.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009.
