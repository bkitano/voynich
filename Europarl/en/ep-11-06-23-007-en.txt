It is important that macro-regional strategies be examined in the context of the objective of European territorial cohesion prescribed in the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU's territorial development plan for 2020.
Cohesion policy is a pillar of the Europe 2020 strategy, so the money allocated to cohesion policy in the next common financial framework should not be less than the amounts made available in the current programming period.
Cohesion policy after 2013 should continue to be an important factor in the development of Europe.
At present, when there are more than 23 million unemployed, cohesion policy is one of the policies that can also contribute to creating new jobs.
