A very warm welcome to the European Parliament, Sir Jonathan! (Applause) As our first guest in this year of intercultural dialogue, the Grand Mufti of Syria, Sheikh Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun, made a speech in our plenary session.
Chief Rabbi, in your book The Dignity of Difference - and on this point I will close - which was written a year after the terrible events of 11 September 2001, you tackled one of the most fundamental questions of our day, namely: can we all live together in peace and, if so, how?
I want to begin by reminding us that European civilisation was born 2 000 years ago in a dialogue, a dialogue between the two greatest cultures of antiquity: Ancient Greece and Biblical Israel - Athens and Jerusalem.
The second great moment of intercultural dialogue took place at the beginning of the Italian Renaissance when a young Christian intellectual, Pico della Mirandola, travelled to Padua, where he met a Jewish scholar, Rabbi Elijah Delmedigo, who taught him the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud and Kabbalah in their original languages.
The result has been that, after almost 2 000 years of estrangement and tragedy, today Jews and Christians meet in mutual respect as friends.
I want to draw attention to two passages in the opening chapters of the Bible whose meaning has been lost in translation for 2 000 years.
You see, between the late 18th century and 1933, there was dialogue between Jews and Germans, just as there was dialogue and even friendship between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda, or between Serbs and Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo.
It played a major role in European politics in the 16th and 17th centuries in Switzerland, in Holland, in Scotland and in England.
Sir Jonathan, thank you for your great message.
Thank you, Sir Jonathan. (Applause)
