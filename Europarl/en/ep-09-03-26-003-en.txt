Collective redress (debate) The next item is the Commission statement on collective redress.
We have commissioned studies, discussed the issue with stakeholders, conducted surveys and an Internet consultation, and recently published a green paper to which we have received more than 170 responses.
The green paper on consumer collective redress proposed various ways of tackling this problem.
Consumer organisations favour binding measures for a collective redress judicial scheme in all Member States in combination with other options, such as the extension of existing alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms to collective claims.
On 29 May we will hold a hearing to share our preliminary conclusions with stakeholders.
However, as you have also said, Commissioner, we need to design these instruments in such a way as to prevent the extremes seen in the US, for example, from creeping in, and instead tailor them to our own legal system.
Commissioner, you know that we are on your side with regard to this matter.
We received many responses, many of which - from businesses and consumers - highlighted the need for effective access to cross-border remedies and redress.
