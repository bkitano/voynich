The European Union's 27 Member States account for more than 89 000 kilometres of coastline.
According to available data, by 2010 approximately 75% of humanity will live in coastal regions.
In order to give the policy a concrete form, the Commission adopted in October 2007 the action plan for an integrated maritime policy, which is gradually being applied.
In this context I am delighted to tell you that based on the interest expressed in the report of Mrs Madeira, the Commission will be able to organise discussions on topics related to tourism in coastal areas within the framework of the conference to mark European Maritime Day, which will take place on 19 and 20 May 2009.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 16 December 2008.
