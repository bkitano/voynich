This year the Conference of Presidents has decided to award the Sakharov Prize 2008 to Hu Jia 'on behalf of the silenced voices of China and Tibet' as it states in the proposal for a decision from the Committee on Foreign Affairs. (Applause) Hu Jia was born on 25 July 1973 in Beijing and is one of the most passionate defenders of human rights in the People's Republic of China.
On 27 December 2007, Hu Jia was placed under house arrest on charges of inciting subversion.
In his solitary prison cell, Hu Jia is now fighting his illness.
