Schwab, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European Statistics - C6-0346/2007 -.
This is approximately EUR 230 million.
If we, as the European Union, really can take this situation in hand, I believe that we will make an important step towards less bureaucracy by reducing statistics-based obligations.
In this way, we will provide a bit more transparency for statistics at European level and therefore make the euro area that bit more competitive.
Firstly, the fact is that we have been dealing with Article 285 of the EU Treaty, which discusses the scientific independence of the statistical authorities.
