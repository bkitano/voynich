rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, at this late hour on a Monday the Commission will probably have other things on its mind more worrying than this report.
It should be stressed that the direct taking of evidence as mentioned in Article 17 of the regulation has simplified and accelerated the obtaining of evidence without posing any particular problem.
A handbook on the application of the regulation was produced in 2006 and distributed among all the European courts in 2007.
A study of its application was carried out in March 2007 and, on the basis of the study results, the Commission adopted a report in December 2007.
The report was drawn up according to Article 23 of the regulation.
In the action plan it adopted in November 2008, the Council entrusted the Commission with the creation of a European e-Justice Portal.
