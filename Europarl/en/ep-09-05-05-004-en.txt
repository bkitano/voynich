Energy labelling and standard product information (recast) (debate) The next item is the report by Mrs Podimata, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products (recast) - C6-0412/2008 -.
First, I would like to warn that, if adopted, Amendment 32 would hamper the independence of the media.
I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Podimata, for her report.
In addition, I think that it is important to have this A-G scale, which is simple.
I think that it is in all our interests to have well-informed consumers who can make an enlightened decision to reduce their energy consumption.
Very briefly a second comment, which to my mind is also important: I believe that everything that has been proposed here with regard to burdening media advertising with compulsory information is wrong.
We would all like to achieve the same result, but at this stage we have not yet found the compromise that suits and brings all the potential together to resolve this issue.
Thank you for the debate.
