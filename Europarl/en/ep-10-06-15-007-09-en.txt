Adaptation of the Rules of Procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon ( - Before the vote: (FR) Mr President, I see that unlike President Buzek, you do not suffer from poor lateral vision and you were able to see me.
Thank you, Mr Gollnisch.
We need to add a new citation to link last November's vote with this vote, and I would ask the House to agree that we add the words 'having regard to its decision of 25 November 2009 on the adaptation of Parliament's Rules of Procedure to the Lisbon Treaty'.
