Derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC (debate) The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC, by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - B6-0122/2007).
This means that all 27 Member States procure defence equipment in accordance with their own national regulations, often resulting in non-transparent and sometimes discriminatory practices.
This will also make it easier for Member States to use the derogation under Article 296 of the Treaty only in exceptional cases.
Member States and members of national parliaments seem to be completely unaware of Article 296 of the EC Treaty - as, indeed, it describes an exceptional situation rather than the rule.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, each year, around EUR 180 billion are spent on defence within the borders of the European Union's common market.
We need to analyse this situation, which has resulted from the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in relation to public procurement in the field of defence.
Following on from Mr Lambsdorff's question, I would be very interested to hear how the Commissioner intends to take account of the peculiarities of the defence sector in a directive. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each year, the 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 170 billion on defence.
In other words, offsets are a problem in themselves, even in the area covered by Article 296.
