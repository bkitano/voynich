Coordination of certain of the Member States' provisions on television broadcasting (debate) The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (10076/6/2007 - C6-0352/2007 - (Rapporteur: Mrs Hieronymi).
We therefore greatly welcome the fact that we have been able to update this Directive just in time.
However, we have also improved the financial bases for commercial broadcasting, not by increasing advertising - that still stands at a maximum of 12 minutes per hour - but by introducing more flexible rules.
I think that it will be important to follow developments in this field, so that we do not end up with a situation in which traditional TV media in Europe are in a less favourable position than those which broadcast in non-linear ways, via the Internet or by other means, because in the long term that can damage our chances in the global context.
The numerous new opportunities for even more advertising - whether in sports programmes, series or feature films - will result in a loss of quality in Europe's media.
More flexible regulations on advertising have been introduced, but I believe that maintaining a maximum of 12 minutes per hour is the right thing to do.
It is a considerable step forward for the European audiovisual industry, and I can only rejoice in this along with all the speakers who have said so.
in writing. - (HU) The new regulation for borderless television has had uneven success.
