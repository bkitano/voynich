Commission measures in 2008-2013 to make use of CAP remote-sensing applications (debate) The next item is the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the measures to be undertaken by the Commission in 2008-13 making use of the remote-sensing applications developed within the framework of the common agricultural policy - C6-0273/2007 -.
This system provides the Commission's services with accurate information on the situation in the crop sector and also assists the Commission in taking timely decisions in the framework of the common agricultural policy, and therefore I find that it is quite natural that it is financed by the guidance funding.
I had the task of examining this question in greater depth, and we subsequently decided that we would draft a report, which means that the two of us can discuss the matter again this evening - a useful thing in itself.
It is because of our accountability to our voters that we have discussed this matter and are making this point.
Now we have to consider whether we as a Parliament are in favour of further research into and use of this application.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is true that we sometimes have the opportunity to sit here late in the evening and discuss agricultural issues, but I must say that I enjoyed, no matter how late it is, having an opportunity to exchange views on this - for those of us present here tonight, anyway - very interesting topic.
Voting will take place on Wednesday, 16 January 2008.
