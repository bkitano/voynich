For this reason, this report on the recovery of Community funds takes as its starting point a specific example: never before have we had a bigger sum to recover - it is put at almost EUR 100 million - and the circumstances surrounding the missing money are worse still.
In one of the Member States concerned, the authorities only decided to launch an inquiry four years after the original Italian report came out, and none of the estimated missing EUR 40 million has been recovered.
In another Member State, the inquiry has not even got off the ground, so none of the EUR 50 million-plus has been recovered.
The crux of the matter is that Article 280 of the Treaty is being ignored.
In one particular case, the sum involved is EUR 95 million.
Between 2003 and 2006, the Commission was able to reduce recovery amounts from EUR 553 million to only EUR 160 million by September this year.
The specific case of the 95 million is the subject of a criminal investigation in the court of one Member State and another is involved in the problem.
So in fact less than EUR 100 million have to be recovered in the near future, and EUR 95 million after the investigation has been completed.
The total recovered amounts to less than one fifth of the EUR 6 billion outstanding in 2002.
It is no small thing to have outstanding debts totalling EUR 3 billion.
