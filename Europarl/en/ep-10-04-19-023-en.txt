EU agriculture and climate change (short presentation) The next item is the report by St√©phane Le Foll, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on EU agriculture and climate change (SEC(2009)0417 -.
Mr President, Commissioner, the report I am presenting to Parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming.
This report deals, therefore, with the specific issue of agriculture in relation to the fight against global warming, but it also claims - in any case I hope it does - to explore other ways of sustaining, in particular, the debate that will be taking place on the future of agricultural policy post-2013.
The 2013 CAP needs to be ambitious.
Thus, we have already succeeded in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in agriculture by 20%.
Agriculture must be ecologically sustainable and, in this regard, we have much work to do.
Therefore, our common agricultural policy must, from 2013 onwards, create a market for environmental public goods so that farmers may receive additional services and compensation for these additional services which they perform. (FI) Mr President, this own-initiative report concerns an extremely important area, because the role played by agriculture will only increase in the future.
Because of this, I was also a little disappointed that in the EU's 2020 strategy, a minuscule amount was invested in agriculture and forestry.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Le Foll, for this very important report on agriculture and climate change.
The part that European farmers can play in this will come into clearer focus in the ongoing debate on the future shape of the CAP post-2013 and it is essential that the EU assists our farmers in striking this balance.
