rapporteur. - Madam President, my thanks are due to the shadow rapporteurs and all on the Fisheries Committee for producing a well-balanced report on what is a very complex and in many ways sensitive issue.
The report recognises the main advantage of rights-based management systems as being increased economic rationale in fisheries.
As stated in the report, such systems are a complex matter, but difficulties associated with them are not insurmountable.
This does not mean that these sectors and Member States are in a better situation, or even in the same situation as they were 30 years ago, but rather they are dragging the more dynamic sectors towards a dead end.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) I should like to begin by paying tribute to the commitment of the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, in drawing up a balanced report on a question as fundamental as the sovereignty of Member States in the management of their fisheries resources and the setting up of private property rights for access to and exploitation of that public good.
