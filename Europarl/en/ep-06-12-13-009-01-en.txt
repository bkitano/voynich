We have tried to take the Socialist Group's Amendment 16 as a basis for this, and have put it into a form corresponding to the facts of the situation since Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers.
The rapporteur and the author of the amendment are agreed on this. (The oral amendment was adopted) - Before the vote on Amendment 17: (EL) Mr President, in Amendment 17 tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I wish to change the term ' Northern Cyprus' to the term 'Turkish Cypriot Community'.
