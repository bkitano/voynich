author. - Mr President, the annual report on the human rights situation in Syria for 2006 makes very grim reading indeed.
Those arrested included the brilliant writer Michel Kilo and the human rights campaigner Anwar al-Bunni.
The year 2006 passed without the Syrian authorities providing any information on the fate of 17 000 people arrested by the Syrian security forces.
