Under Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure, I am asking the Members of the House to postpone the vote on the Onesta report with regard to the petitions process, as this matter is at present being dealt with in the Conference of Presidents in the context of the reform of the procedures of the House.
Personally, I can live with postponing it until 5 March; I can even live with a 'speed vote' withdrawing that amendment.
