A European strategy on the Roma (vote) - Before the vote on Amendment 9 (IT) Mr President, I wanted to remove the words 'traditional practices' from the oral amendment, that is, the last two words of paragraph 9.
If you wish I can read the text that remains: 'calls on the Roma to respect human rights, in particular with regard to women and children, avoiding forced marriages'. (The oral amendment was accepted.) (Amendment 9 was subsequently rejected.)
