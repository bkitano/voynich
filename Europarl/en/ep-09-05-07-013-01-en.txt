Iran: the case of Roxana Saberi The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iran: the case of Roxana Saberi.
author. - Madam President, Iran is notorious for its human rights record, as was noted just yesterday during the debate on the human rights situation in the world.
The fact is that Ms Saberi has had no access to her lawyer for more than a month.
It is true that she has ended this, but her health is in a very precarious state.
As reported by the movement which fights for the abolition of the death penalty, Tire as MÃ£os de Caim, Iran is the country with the highest number of executions per capita in the world.
Just this morning, four people were executed in Evin prison, with another eight having been executed in Taibad prison on 2 May.
We are talking about Roxana Saberi, an American-Iranian journalist who worked for ABC Radio, the BBC and South African television.
Yesterday the BBC announced that next week, on 12 May, the Appeal Court will hear Roxana Saberi's appeal, but that this would again take place in a closed-door session.
The execution of Delara Darabi, the detention of the journalist Maryam Malek and defenders of workers' rights - these are but a few examples.
They hanged Dilara Darabi for a crime she denied committing at the age of 17.
Madam President, I wish to support my colleague - even though he is Scottish - Struan Stevenson.
There are many Iranians who are decent and good people.
The Commission fully supported the declaration issued by the Czech Presidency of the Council on Ms Saberi's case on 22 April 2009.
The recent execution of Ms Delara Darabi, hanged on 1 May for a crime she allegedly committed when she was a minor, is another confirmation of this dismal situation.
Written statements (Rule 142) in writing. - The sentencing of Roxana Saberi on 18 April 2009 for 'spying' was done without her having any access to a lawyer and on the basis of a trial that was neither fair nor transparent.
