I can get a plane ticket from Manchester to Prague on my computer at the click of a button, but just try getting a train ticket from Manchester to Prague.
I do consider Amendment 37 at any rate to be of key importance in this framework.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will therefore be rejecting Amendment 18, and I should like to ask the rapporteur to do likewise. (FR) I too would like to congratulate our new President of the sitting: welcome, Mr President!
Miguel Ángel, who would have guessed, when, under the isolation of the Franco dictatorship, you left from Alcázar de San Juan, which was Spain's symbolic rail and trade union hub, that European railways would take you once again tonight to Alcázar de San Juan, but this time as Vice-President of the European Parliament?
Hence our vote in favour of Amendment 33.
I personally am not in favour of altering the Council's position on this point, since a hurried, and perhaps ill-prepared, opening up of national passenger transport could have serious consequences for the service.
I would also like to thank Mr Sterckx for supporting our group's amendment, which is intended to take account of the specific situation of suburban transport, which is particularly relevant in terms of public service obligations. (DE) Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you!
Perhaps I will be convinced in time, but at the moment, when it comes to national liberalisation, I do not want to be a part of it. (PL) Mr President, I am delighted with the results obtained in the course of negotiations led by the rapporteurs for this third railway package.
We must not impose additional burdens on railways if we want to prevent them going back into decline. (LT) I would support the liberalisation of rail transport services if the social effect of opening up rail networks and its effects on the environment were to be analysed in depth.
I would urge you not to support my colleague Mr Sterckx's report on the twenty-first amendment, which, in my opinion, weakens the Council's motion. (HU) I wish to draw attention to a few questions, the first of which is generally economic in nature.
It should not be the case that there is no deadline in the services directive, or that in some places we wish to liberalise only partially, because let us say as a German I am sensitive to this matter, whereas in other respects we need to open up services completely, for instance in financial or rail services.
The new Member States are struggling with a great many problems of domestic government administration.
The year 2022 in the current proposal is already quite friendly in this regard.
The Savary proposal, in my opinion, goes in the right direction from this point of view, that is, truly towards the deepening of the internal market.
In connection with the Sterckx report - although of course everything it contains is very attractive - I must say, as a representative of a new Member State, that this will cost us a great deal, especially if we have to do this in the first ten years before the introduction of free movement of persons and the introduction of the euro.
The liberalisation of rail transport is something that needs to be brought about, but progress has been painstaking.

Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure (FR) I am delighted that rail passengers are finally going to have rights, particularly in relation to compensation, information and facilities for persons with reduced mobility.
With regard to Mr Jarzembowski's report, while the liberalisation of international passenger transport is a good thing, which increases the efficiency of that mode of transport, I do not agree with the rapporteur's views on the opening up to competition of national traffic.
Secondly, if Parliament decides to open up national rail traffic to competition, I feel that it is important to ensure that, during the transitional period in which only international traffic is opened up, we prevent the veiled opening up of national passenger transport through the practice of cabotage.
