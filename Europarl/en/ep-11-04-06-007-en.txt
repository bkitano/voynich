Request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before the vote, I should like to take a few moments to remind the House, the Council and the European Commission that two years ago, there was an earthquake in L'Aquila in which 309 people died and over 1 650 people were injured.
Now I have raised the matter, I will send all MEPs today a video that was filmed in L'Aquila on 13 January.
Thank you, Mrs Alfano.
