The principal demands placed on Mugabe by the SADC are to keep to the date set for the Presidential elections in 2008 and to cease repression of the opposition.
On 30 March, the central committee of the Zanu-PF party decided to hold Presidential elections in March 2008 and to bring forward the Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for 2010, to 2008 as well.
It has branded members of the Tsvangirai wing of the MDC opposition party terrorists and, in so doing, is trying to drive a wedge between the opposition which united for the first time following the March unrest.
Already by the end of 2006, the party congress of the Zanu-PF party had demonstrated that Mugabe's position was no longer undisputed.
Their impressive, even oppressive, presence in front of the central committee's session building certainly had an impact on the decision-making process of politburo members in favour of Mugabe's appointment as a Presidential candidate.

Two people were killed and 300 were arrested.
One fifth of its population is infected with HIV, and there 3 200 new cases every week.
This regime is founded on a campaign that is absurd and criminal in equal measure, as a result of which since 2000, thousands of productive farms have been confiscated from their white owners and handed over to Mugabe's incompetent and indifferent figureheads, resulting in a large-scale famine.
The correspondent R.W.
Arnold Tsunga, chairman of the human rights organisation Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, used identical words to describe the situation.
My message to the Council, the Commission, and to this House, is that this indictment of cunning, implicit genocide should never give us one moment's peace until such time as it can be withdrawn. (DE) Madam President, Mr Pafilis, four minutes ago, you gave the most cynical speech on Zimbabwe which has been heard in this House since 1999.
Unfortunately, the power of the regimes in these very countries is still sufficient to hit out at the population, as happened most recently on 11 March.
