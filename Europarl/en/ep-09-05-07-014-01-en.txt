Iran: the case of Roxana Saberi Madam President, my proposal is that the words 'Iranian authorities' at the beginning of paragraph 3 should be replaced by 'Appeals Court at its hearing of 12 May'.
Paragraph 3 would then read: 'Urges the Appeals Court at its hearing of 12 May to release Roxana Saberi...'.
Therefore we thought it was appropriate to add to paragraph 7 the following: 'in this context insists that the authorities of Islamic Republic of Iran urgently abolish the practice of stoning; condemns strongly the recent execution by stoning of Vali Azad, and expresses great concern over the pending execution of Mohammad Ali Navid Khamami and Ashraf Kalhori;'.
