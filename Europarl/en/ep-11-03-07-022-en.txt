The reason why we drew up this own-initiative report is that the Commission is intending to start work on a revision of the General Product Safety Directive, which thus provided a good opportunity for us in the Internal Market Committee to present our recommendations for what this revision should contain.
It is the case that, in a time of crisis, there is, unfortunately, a risk that the Member States will allocate fewer rather than more resources to ensuring that market surveillance is carried out.
In connection with my work on this report, I have spoken to a large number of enterprises on the internal market, many of which said that they have never known there to be any controls, market checks or market surveillance in respect of the products that they are involved with on the internal market.
We also believe that there is a general need for the Member States to act more swiftly when we discover dangerous or problematic products on the internal market.
I would also call on the Member States to allocate sufficient resources to ensuring that proper market surveillance is carried out. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mrs Schaldemose for the constructive and fruitful cooperation we have had.
The Commission is determined to make sure that both consumers and businesses benefit from the EU internal market in safe goods.
In particular, consistency between the general product safety rules laid down in the General Product Safety Directive and the rules contained in the 2008 'goods package' should now be within our grasp.
