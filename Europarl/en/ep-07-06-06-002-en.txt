Statements by the President (membership of Parliament; ETA) Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great joy for me to be able to welcome today 18 fellow Members from Bulgaria - the first directly elected MEPS - to this House, and thus into our midst. (Applause) The citizens of Bulgaria went to the polls on 20 May 2007 and elected their representatives to the European Parliament in a democratic process.
It took over 60 years for Bulgaria to be restored to a free Europe and for our continent to be reunited.
It is claimed to be the site of one of the oldest countries in Europe, founded in 681.
