Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EC and Serbia ( Before the vote on Amendment 4: Madam President, I would like to table an oral amendment to this Amendment No 4 by Ms Brantner and me, deleting the latter part.
In order to have broader support for this amendment, I also want to submit a very short oral - basically compromise - amendment, originally prepared by Mrs Maria Eleni Koppa.
I want to add the word 'initial' between 'the government's' and 'decision', so the wording will be 'Regrets the government's initial decision not to attend the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December; welcomes, on the other hand, the Ombudsman's initiative to attend the ceremony as a responsible and praiseworthy decision'.
