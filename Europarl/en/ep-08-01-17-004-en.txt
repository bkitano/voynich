The Commission supports the Forum in this form.
Two meetings have been held so far: in 2006 in Athens and 2007 in Rio.
I would like also to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say something more concrete on the IGF (we have adopted this abbreviation) which took place in November in Rio de Janeiro.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Second Internet Governance Forum was held in Rio from 12 to 15 November last year, and was attended by 2 100 people from all five continents representing interested Internet parties from all public and private sectors.
Madam President, I would like to join with Ms Trautmann - and I think I am speaking for all my other colleagues as well - in expressing my gratitude to the Parliament Presidency for having enabled us to go as an official delegation.
For this reason I feel we must congratulate ourselves on the commitment we are making in Europe.
Look in i2010, look in the programmes for research, etc.
