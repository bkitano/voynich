The following proposed amendment has been tabled with the agreement of the political groups: Wednesday: The title of the Commission statement on the political situation in Honduras with a view to the elections on 29 November 2009 will be amended as follows: 'Commission statement - Political situation in Honduras'.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the PPE Group does not agree with the change to the name that was on the agenda regarding Honduras, and disagrees with the suggestion that the title referring to the 29 November elections be deleted.
There is no truth in the idea that the 29 November elections are taking place because of the events in June.
I also think that the 29 November elections are part of the solution, not part of the problem.
