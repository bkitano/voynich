Statements by the President One week ago today, on 26 November, a dramatic series of coordinated terrorist attacks took place in Mumbai in India.
Ladies and gentlemen, in particular I should like to greet the following in our midst: Ignasi Guardans, who led the delegation, Daniel Caspary, BÃ©la Glattfelder, Syed Kamall, Sajjad Karim, Erika Mann, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and Mia De Vits.
It is wonderful that you are all here again. (Applause) I am also delighted that the following Members of the European Parliament are with us again and I greet them just as warmly: Alberto Rodas, Christopher Ford, Levente Csaszi and Vladymyr Dedobbeleer, and members of the political Groups Arielle Rouby and Barbara Melis as well as the interpreters Vincent Capet from the European Parliament and the two freelance interpreters Karen Twidle and Michael Hill. (Applause) We are all relieved that all in all you are well, and I hope that you can soon recover from this terrible experience mentally as well.
According to official figures from the World Health Organisation WHO, between 1999 and 2006 more than 800 000 new infections were confirmed in Europe - just under 270 000 of them in the Member States of the European Union.
At least every tenth newly infected person is under 25 years old.
