7. ( - Before the vote on Amendment 21 rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like Amendment 21 to be moved to after paragraph 40. (The request was granted.) - Before the vote on Amendment 62 rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, this was for a linguistic oral correction to Amendment 62 to remind the House that the reference is in French and that the term 'income' in the English version has been retained.
Moreover, the French version will constitute the reference for all amendments.
I am referring to the roll-call vote on amendment 55. - At the end of the vote on the Castex report - (NL) Madam President, I find it strange for the House to be voting on a report that still has amendments under consideration on some of its pages.
