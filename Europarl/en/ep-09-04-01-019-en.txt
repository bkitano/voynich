Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 entered into force on 11 April 2007, about two years ago, replacing the rules on driving hours and rest periods that had remained unchanged for more than twenty years.
The legislation must be predictable.
The European Commission adopted a package of measures in January 2009 to prevent tachograph misuse and reinforce Member States' options for verifying compliance with the regulations on driving time and rest periods.
I believe that one of the most important aspects which the Commission must bear in mind is the value of transposing Directive No 22/2006 into Member States' national legislations and the harmonisation of national provisions drafted as a result of Article 19 of Regulation No 561/2006.
