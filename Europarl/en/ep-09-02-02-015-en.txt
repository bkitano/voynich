Production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various EU Member States (debate) The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various EU Member States.
It is about production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various European Member States.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that we are facing an extremely serious industrial crisis, and the European textile industry cannot escape this crisis, which is also a product of the financial crisis.
I would also like to reiterate that it is a problem that concerns the United States together with us, and does not just concern China or India.
More than a year has passed since the debate held in this Parliament on 12 December 2007.
Almost 20 000 workers may become unemployed.
It means that the surveillance system we have had in place all this time is not working.
As stated by Mrs Wortmann-Kool earlier, 350 000 jobs have been lost over the past two years.
My first point is the question of the European Union's special monitoring mechanism for textiles, which ended, as mentioned, on 31 December 2008.
I committed in my hearing to ensure that I would do that, and I am continuing to do so.
