Some 100 000 women from conquered countries in the Far East were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan.
It must be conceded that during the post-war period the Japanese Government did much to compensate for these dreadful offences against the women who experienced them.
author. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to start by expressing my solidarity with these women - I believe on behalf of all of us.
Anyway, I am pleased that this is now on our agenda and that we are just about to adopt it.
Historians' estimates assume that around 200 000 of these 'comfort women' from Korea, China, Taiwan and the Philippines were handed over to Japanese soldiers as sex slaves.
In 1997 the Japanese Government was asked for the first time to take legal and moral responsibility internationally for the most severe human rights violations committed against women.
We are therefore asking the Japanese Government publicly to reject any assertions that deny or question the subjugation and enslavement of the comfort women and we are likewise demanding that they accept moral and legal responsibility for the enslavement of 200 000 people.
Many victims of the comfort women system have passed away or are at least 80 years old, which means speed is of the essence.
Today, the remaining survivors are 80 and more years of age and one could argue that the problem is no longer an important issue.
Japan has thereby recognised its responsibility for these unspeakable human rights violations.
The vote on these three topics will take place at the end of today's sitting.
