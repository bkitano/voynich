Order of business The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 8 February 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated.
That is, after all, what gives our debate real substance and political meaning. (Parliament adopted the motion.) Mr President, may I enquire why you have not made use of Rule 156 of the Rules of Procedure in relation to the reports from the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners?
Rule 156 was added to the Rules of Procedure in the reform three years ago in order to provide a filter when we are faced with a very long voting time.
Rule 156 gives the President enormous power in this respect, even if the Conference of Presidents disagrees with him.
