Thank you, Mrs Ludford.
For instance, the Technical Group, the TDI Group, which did not table any amendments at committee stage whatsoever, has now arrived in plenary with between 20 and 30 amendments, many of which are contradictory.
That does not respect our own Rules of Procedure, which allow only 32 members or a group to table amendments in plenary.
So five or six people had questions down to Commissioner Byrne, but none of us were here to ask the questions.
Commissioner Byrne seems to have taken offence at this and seen it as some kind of snub.
But it is very difficult for Members to sit right through every single question during Question Time just in case we jump from No 1 to No 99 in a matter of seconds.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna.
Thank you, Mr Wynn, I cannot answer you right now, but I will have the matter investigated.
Thank you, Mrs Laguiller.
Mr Ribeiro e Castro will present the motion.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report should not have been admitted.
We are all attached to fundamental rights and the rule of law, starting here in this House.
Anything which discriminates in our legal and political conditions, between our political parties and groups in terms of freedom and equality affects our right of representation and ultimately the rights and very freedom of our electors.
Paragraph 15 ruins the whole text by defiling a very serious issue.
We therefore propose, in order to defend Europe and the rule of law, the immediate rejection of this report.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
Madam President, I think Mr Ribeiro e Castro is quite right to consider the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report inadmissible because it conflicts with and even infringes a number of rights enshrined in our institutions.
But more generally I believe this report infringes a whole range of different rights, beginning with the rights of the small and medium-sized states which have formed an integral part of our institutions and been highly respected by them since the early days of the Treaty of Rome.
Thank you, Mr Berthu.
I call on Members to vote against this motion.
We must examine and vote on the report during this part-session, because it is not a matter of voting for the two rapporteurs but of voting for the European Parliament' s opinion.
However, I also believe that the strong language my fellow delegates are using is completely uncalled for.
We have recital 15.
All in all, I believe that there is no call for excessively strong language, and I am also in favour of us rejecting this amendment.
Today, through the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Union is being called upon to address the great challenges involved in the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, challenges we all recognise, which are important, which influence the course of the European Union every day, and challenges which, above all, raise a fundamental issue: how ready are we, as an institution, as the European Union, to face them?
The Intergovernmental Conference attempts to answer just that question.
The first point is once again to consolidate the institutional nature of the European Union.
The second point is to reconfirm and consolidate another important principle, the principle of a balance of powers, a principle that relates precisely to the role and relationship of those who participate in the European Union, a principle expressed by the way all the Member States express themselves in all - I repeat, all - the European Union' s institutional bodies.
The third basic principle safeguarded in the report is the proposal for a general - and I stress the word general - review of all the institutional bodies that make up the European Union.
It is only natural, when already in a Europe with 15 Member States we find and all agree that some things do not work quite so well and must be put right, that this will be all the more necessary when we it concerns a European Union with 18, 20, 25 and 27 Member States.
Closer cooperation, at least as we view it, must comprise two main elements.
Secondly, it must contain a very highly developed element of democratic awareness, which means that if any country or countries for some reason do not wish to participate, at least during a first phase, this should not be regarded as an exclusion or as a factor that restricts the presence of those countries in the European Union.
Doubling the number of Member States requires far-reaching reform of the working structures and the decision-making procedures in the Union, so that this whole undertaking does not become incapable of acting.
That is the most crucial issue and it must be the yardstick for gauging the success or failure of this Intergovernmental Conference.
This would not be in the interests of our citizens and our countries.
That is why it is so important for some countries to integrate more closely, as we put it, if we want European unification to take place within the confines of the European Union rather than outside them.
I ask myself what kind of message this Intergovernmental Conference sends out to our citizens.
We also want to improve our opportunities for supervising the Commission.
A Europe of the citizens - to pick up on a theme I touched on before - also goes hand in hand with the Charter of Citizen' s Rights in the Union.
The reform of the European Treaties must deliver two things: more efficiency and more democracy.
If the European Treaty of Nice succeeds in this, then the prospects are good for achieving stability and also acceptance amongst the citizens in an enlarged European Union.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to make a few brief comments on foreign policy.
The Treaty of Amsterdam made it possible for there to be far-reaching integration of the Western European Union into the Treaty; in particular, it transferred the Petersberg tasks.
Therefore it is to be hoped that the Convention, under the leadership of Roman Herzog, will put forward a catalogue of fundamental rights which we will be able to include in the Treaty in a legally binding manner, and that on this basis, we will then be able to define our values in such a way that many of the things we discussed in the past will no longer be possible, because we will have a clear legal provision in place.
If we succeed in this then, all in all, we will have made considerable progress, and will thus have created the conditions necessary to the enlargement of the European Union.
This should be enshrined in the Treaty, for it is already included in our Rules of Procedure and is, as I said, established practice.
For years we have endeavoured to protect the financial interests of the Community more effectively.
It is the view of this Committee that the construction of this area of justice is important and, to this end, a reform of the Court of Justice is necessary.
Our first demand is therefore that qualified majority be established with the assent of the European Parliament.
With regard to the Court, Parliament also asks to be able to participate in the process of selecting judges as already happens with the posts in the constitutional courts in our states.
Lastly, Madam President, we want to see a reform of the Treaty so that Parliament, in relation to the third pillar, also has full access to justice by means of repeal in the event of regulations and acts which do not conform.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would like to highlight three demands that we have to make of the Intergovernmental Conference, although all of them relate to the same facts.
But we still have 15 different economic policies in the Member States of the European Union, and we will only succeed in the long-term if this economic policy is framed according to common principles.
Hence our first demand is that we should firmly establish the social market economy, which adds a human dimension to the functioning of the market, in the European Treaty, as a model for our economic policy.
The Court of First Instance must be better accommodated in this framework, and both jurisdictions must be able to take more autonomous decisions regarding their own structures and procedures.
But in order to bring the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs as far as possible into line with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I tabled four more amendments in the plenary meeting.
As some of these amendments are also to be found in the opinions of other committees, I believe that these amendments deserve - and will probably receive - the support of the entire Parliament.
This is why we need to seize this opportunity with both hands to prepare the European Union, with all its institutions and in all fields, to face the challenges of the 21st century successfully. , draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. (ES) Madam President, the conditions of my intervention in this plenary session are illustrative of the budgetary problem.
I have just hurried from a meeting which, according to the Treaty, does not exist.
It is the adaptation of the Treaty, Article 272 in particular, to the real situation.
We have renewed them three times, and we believe that the time has come to include the fundamental principles in the Treaty so that we will not find ourselves in legally dubious situations, such as the case of the meeting which I have just mentioned.
When there are 25 members, the current procedure will not work.
I would like to raise two points.
There are no clear guidelines on institutional mechanisms for defining a common energy policy, let alone cooperation to guarantee the supply of energy or in terms of the environmental aspects of energy policy.
This means that the codecision procedure needs to apply to the EURATOM Treaty too.
I would therefore urge you most emphatically to vote for Amendment No 60 which I have tabled on behalf of my group, so that uniform safety standards can be drawn up for nuclear reactors.
The second major point is the Union' s legal personality.
Indeed, it then becomes possible to ratify a number of Treaties, such as ILO Treaties and some UN Treaties in the social field, which will add legal clarity to this type of issue.
The fisheries policy is one of those policies that makes a substantial contribution to the realisation of the single market.
It strengthens economic and social conditions.
It is obvious that the fisheries sector is not an isolated pawn in the game, for it has an impact on sectors such as development, the environment and foreign relations.
As a Community policy in its own right in the Union treaty, the fisheries sector will unite these aspects to good effect, for that is what we want to achieve: we want to place the fisheries sector on an independent administrative and legislative footing, in relation to agriculture for example.
In fact this political responsibility inevitably gives rise to a claim to the most far-reaching of codecision rights.
Madam President, the proposals by the Committee on Women' s Rights for the Intergovernmental Conference aim to enhance democracy and effectiveness.
We declare that balanced participation of women and men in decision-making at every level is a prerequisite for democracy and social justice, and we are therefore asking for the related articles of the Treaties to be amended to take account of that principle in the composition of the Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
We also stress the need for a close link between the Intergovernmental Conference and the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, so that within the scope of the constitutionalisation of the Union, the fundamental right of equality between women and men will be enshrined in Community law.
The issue tackled at the last IGC meeting was the question of extending qualified majority voting.
As regards the decision-making procedure in the European Parliament, there is broad consensus that no revision of the Treaty should be effected which involves changing the existing institutional balance.
Many consider that changes should only be made where strictly necessary to ensure the effective functioning of the European Union after enlargement.
It should be recalled that the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council specify that the Council presidency will submit a report to the European Council and may propose in this report the insertion of new items on the IGC' s agenda.
In the area of security and defence and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Council presidency considers that, depending on the progress of the work, the right should be reserved to propose to the Feira European Council next June the inclusion in the IGC of any adjustments or additions to the Treaties which may prove necessary in these areas.
However, there is clear disagreement between, on one hand, the small and medium-sized Member States which want a Commission composed of one national from each Member State, all with equal status, and, on the other, the large Member States which favour a fixed number of Commissioners regardless of the number of Member States.
As for the Commission' s collective responsibility as a college, there is some reluctance to accept alterations to the current institutional framework, with the current supervision exercised by the European Parliament being regarded as sufficient.
The idea submitted by this House of the Commission being able to request a vote of confidence in it was positively welcomed.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you, and also the French Council Presidency that is to succeed you, bear a huge responsibility, because the outcome of this Intergovernmental Conference will be of historic significance, be it for positive or negative reasons.
Recital 1 sets out the benchmarks that the Intergovernmental Conference must work to: balance between the institutions, dual legitimacy of the European Union as a Union of peoples and a Union of States, and - something which is particularly important - balance between the small and large States of the European Union.
Certainly we have yet to discuss in detail how this is to be accomplished, but the principle of double majority is fundamentally right.
As far as the Commission is concerned, as I see it, the small States must still be entitled, in the future, to be represented in the European Commission, since it is felt to be important to maintain a presence in Brussels.
Naturally, the European Parliament must be the decisive factor in the democratic process, and it must participate in decisions pertaining to legislative issues in the European Union.
This is a very important point and I am delighted that both rapporteurs saw fit to mention it.
Mr President, with the Dimitrakopoulos - Leinen report under discussion, the European Parliament is declaring its great vision for the European Union of the future.
The draft resolution is therefore quite right to define that basic view in the form of three principles.
Thirdly, the way the Union functions must be made more effective, so that it can cope with the major enlargement.
The Intergovernmental Conference of 2000 is taking place to make the Union as effective as is required in view of the major enlargement that has been decided.
The effectiveness of democratic institutions is not measured either with a stopwatch, or according to the number of decisions taken.
Mr President, within our groups in Parliament and within the IGC itself we are still struggling with the problems that proved fairly intractable at Amsterdam.
These issues are tricky because they expose both the exaggerated self-importance of small states and the folie de grandeur of the big states.
This trust is precisely the quality that is needed so that we are able to ensure the successful accession of the new Member States.
The fact is - and somebody should say this - that if the IGC fails to resolve the Amsterdam questions, enlargement must be postponed.
The Liberal Group supports the efforts of the presidency and of the Commission to build up the extra trust required.
Mr President, the European Parliament does not take part in Intergovernmental Conference negotiations.
Therefore, our assessment of this report is based on the fact that it is being presented in an unsatisfactory context, in which our priorities - an open, working democracy capable of rendering economic development environmentally sustainable, which ensures the respect and consolidation of the rights of the citizens and residents, and, most importantly, which is able to enlarge to include new Member countries in a short period of time - are not the same as those of the negotiating governments.
The governments have one sole objective: to reach a unanimous agreement in Nice, whatever the outcome, so that they do not have to move on to some other city as obscure as Maastricht.
Although Parliament cannot take part in negotiations, it has a duty to indicate the way, to define clear options for the future, without pretending to take part in the actual negotiations and without being conditioned by governmental pressure or pressure from artificial comparisons, such as the comparison between large and small countries.
This report only partly achieves this objective, and this is why our Group was not able to be unanimous in its final assessment.
In this regard, we hope that our amendment will find consensus in the House.
In particular, as regards the subject of the number of Commissioners, we will support the balanced position of those amendments which ensure both sufficient representation of the Member States and the efficiency of the Commission.
To sum up, this report may well be useful in assisting our two representatives in their often extremely frustrating daily work at the Intergovernmental Conference where others take the decisions, but to our citizens, it will seem about as clear as an interministerial memorandum.
It is making sure that we do not just build a Europe of the States and a Europe of the people, but, especially, a Europe of the citizens.
We must create a fully democratic institutional fabric.
We cannot create an Amsterdam 2.
We have to create a Treaty which gives rise to genuine European construction in which more than 400 million Europeans can share economic prosperity, a social dimension and a democratic life.
This is the great challenge for the European institutions and for European politics.
My vision of European construction is compatible with the fundamental lines which are laid out in the report which we are discussing today.
It is, of course, necessary to give the Commission the powers it needs and make it responsible to Parliament.
Our minimum demand is that Parliament be treated as an adult which has to request that the Commission take certain responsibilities, but which also has to participate actively in European construction on behalf of the European citizens.
On behalf of the European citizens, we have to ask today not only for that fine-tuning of decision making but also for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty.
Mr President, in our view the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, as set out in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, are a misinterpretation.
First of all, it takes us away from the concept of Europe as an association of states, an association of national democracies, and puts all the countries, great or small, that are afraid of being marginalised on the defensive.
We must adopt a more positive approach.
The asset under our constitutions is the right of voters to be heard and to choose representatives who can pass laws on our behalf.
They are taking legislative power from our 15 national parliaments and transferring it to officials and ministers, from voters and elected representatives to the executive and from open assemblies to meetings behind closed doors in Brussels.
Electoral power is being transferred from our constitutions, but is not being transferred to the European Parliament.
The voters in our countries should always have the last word.
Mr President, dismayed as I am at the ongoing prejudice shown towards Austria by 14 Member States, I would like to confine my comments on the matter at hand to the issue of closer cooperation, in all its guises.
Multi-speed integration of this kind cannot act as a guarantee for coherent and stable development of the Union.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am speaking as draftsman of the opinion of this Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I understand the importance of institutional reforms, but I would also like to express the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the issues which we must tackle in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference.
Firstly, the active recognition of the role, protagonism and participation of the regions in the process of European construction which began 50 years ago.
To this end, we want an extended Article 70 and we also want it to be supplemented with a provision on the creation of a single European agency for air traffic control.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has set out a determined position and I want to pay tribute to its work and that of its chairman, Mr Napolitano.
Parliament, like the Commission, has sized up the challenge facing the Union with the prospect of an unprecedented increase in the number of Member States which, by the same token, will accentuate their diversity.
That is what is at stake in these negotiations, which we must bring to a successful conclusion at the end of this year, at the European Council in Nice.
I am thinking, for example, of the Court of Justice' s workload and of the log-jams we see in some areas because of the requirement of unanimity in the Council.
Your Parliament has looked in depth at the decision-making system in the Council and at the composition and functioning of the Commission.
Since 26 January you have been well aware of the positions set out by the Commission.
But we also proposed two options on that basis.
Either every country will have a national representative within the Commission at the same time, or not all countries will be represented at any one time.
Negotiations on these issues have scarcely begun.
Qualified majority voting should become the general rule for Council decisions, together with the codecision procedure for all matters that come within the legislative sphere.
We are well aware that certain Member States have difficulties with some of these questions.
What the Commission, what the European Parliament must do is precisely to look beyond these reservations and sincerely, honestly and without any ideological bias consider the coherence and effectiveness of the single market.
That is what we wanted to do with our additional contribution which describes the new area of qualified majority voting in relation to certain aspects of the tax system, certain aspects of social protection, to ensure the smooth operation of the single market.
But I also want to emphasise how important it is for us, outside our official and institutional establishments, to explain our activities and engage in dialogue with the national parliaments and the citizens of every EU country and with the candidate countries.
In saying that, I want to pay tribute to the Portuguese Presidency and in particular to Jame Gama and to Franciscos Seixas da Costa for electing to adopt a pragmatic and objective approach, an approach that is as objective as possible and that consists in starting out from the needs and limitations of the existing system and proposing solutions.
The first point concerns European defence.
Since the Cologne Council, and in particular the Helsinki Council, the necessary structures are being set up, on an interim basis, within the Council' s General Secretariat.
Discussions are under way on relations between the European Union and Nato.
The European Union Defence Ministers met on 28 February.
In a few weeks' time, the European Council in Feira will have to decide whether the Treaty should be amended with a view to building on the guidelines of the Helsinki European Council.
Our group of representatives has not considered these questions yet, but let me share a few ideas with you.
Ladies and gentlemen, after matters relating to justice and the police, a security and defence policy is without doubt the last major common policy we have to establish.
The existing Treaty, as amended at Amsterdam, has enabled us to make significant progress.
It may be that, before it concludes, the Intergovernmental Conference will have to consider the structures and appropriateness of the existing Treaty.
I do not have all the answers to this question but I think it needs to be asked, and to be asked in the context of the Conference.
My second point concerns the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU' s democratic values.
The interest that is being shown in this draft Charter and the support for its incorporation in the Treaty confirm what I regard as the need to reaffirm, over and over again, the fundamental values of the EU, to set down once and for all the principles shared by all the citizens of Europe.
It is the same need that inspired your Parliament' s report drafted by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber.
Your Parliament has considered these questions, as it has considered the existing Treaty provisions that would penalise any violation of the fundamental principles of the Union.
The Commission is prepared for this debate, which I believe is a necessary one, provided we keep it clear of any polemics.
But just as a mountain grows larger the closer you approach it, let me stress that this exercise involves major technical and legal difficulties.
The Treaties are not complicated in the sense of deliberately wanting to discourage the reader; they are complicated because the expression of the common resolve of 6, 9, 10, 12 or 15 Member States, over the efforts of 40 years, is not a linear operation, nor is it always as logical and simple as might be imagined after the fact, unless you start again from scratch.
Then, if this reorganisation of the Treaties proves possible and convincing - as I personally believe it will - it will be time to examine the procedures for amending these restructured texts.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by repeating that I and President Romano Prodi are prepared to continue and intensify these joint discussions so that, together with the Council, indeed all together, we will succeed in achieving a genuine reform at the end of this year.
I believe that this is one of the best reports which have so far been produced in the framework of IGCs over recent years.
As far as our Group is concerned, the resolution needs to be amended on a number of points.
For example, we do not agree with the proposal in the resolution to restrict the number of Commissioners to 20 and to introduce a rota system for the smaller countries.
In order to boost citizens' confidence in the European Commission, it is vital that each Member State should have a Commission Member.
Mr President, firstly, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to express my support for the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report and, furthermore, thank the Portuguese Presidency for their positive attitude towards the incorporation of Parliament into the Intergovernmental Conference.
This report is of great value and I therefore believe we should support it today by a majority in this Parliament, because this is an opportunity for a completely open debate on the great issues still facing us in Europe.
This debate is going on between political and national groups in different Member States.
I believe this should be an important element in our coexistence.
Therefore, this is an important debate and I believe the Council should take account of the position we take.
Secondly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe we should also try to introduce some vision and some idealism into this debate.
These are clear and fundamental challenges, which refer to and are linked to the membership of the Commission, the power of the President, fair contributions by the Member States and such important questions as closer cooperation, majority voting and - a vital issue - the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I say this particularly in view of the crisis which we have seen in a Member State as a result of the presence of a party whose fundamental values are contrary to the community of values which we hold here.
A final consideration: Commissioner Barnier has said that, before the end of the Conference, we must resolve certain problems relating to the chain of command.
Here, the only risk involved in democracy is the risk taken in elections.
This is the risk taken by Minister Gama, Commissioner Barnier and by all of us.
However, here in the gossip shops of Brussels we create a situation and certain centres of power which do not correspond to the principles of democracy and transparency, which are precisely the principles which we have to strengthen in this Intergovernmental Conference.
I believe that it is important for all of the institutions to confront this issue responsibly.
We are to have a security policy worthy of the name, implement administrative reforms and, hopefully, win back some of the confidence our citizens have lost in the European project.
The Intergovernmental Conference should prepare the EU for these changes.
I would like them to know that my scepticism, and any decision on my part to reject this report, is no reflection on them, but on this House, which does not have the backbone to confront the European Council with its own vision of what the future should hold for European integration.
In terms of power politics, or following a constitutional line of thought, it is quite clear what the Council wants.
Separation of powers, public scrutiny of legislation, parliamentarianism, unrestricted legal supervision on the part of the European Court of Justice, binding fundamental rights, strengthening of the original European institutions - the Commission, Parliament and the European Court of Justice - none of these matters are of concern to the Council.
Parliament must pluck up the courage to vie with the Council when it comes to determining the future of European integration.
This is about nothing less than the rediscovery of democracy in the supranational sphere.
It is about nothing less - and this is, or would be Parliament' s task - than making European unification public property.
If you accept without criticism that not only does the Council see itself as a legitimate representative of the States, it also claims to represent the people by virtue of the double majority, thereby depriving Parliament of its legitimacy, then we still have a long way to go before...... (The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, if the changes to the Treaty proposed in the resolution we are debating are implemented, the European Union will take an absolutely crucial step on the way to becoming a federal state and one, moreover, in which the national parliaments will lose control over almost all crucial areas of policy.
The EU' s major problem today is not a lack of centralised power but a shortage of real democracy.
Many adherents of EMU on the Left have, of course, argued in favour of altering the nature of monetary union in such a way that the Central Bank is placed under democratic control and that the goals of economic policy are not merely monetary.
However, any changes within the internal decision-making procedures must be balanced and fair.
We do not want to see a two-tier European Union in which larger Member States dictate the pace at the expense of the smaller Member States.
For example, the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the European Commission.
I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal. 380 million citizens of the Union have an affinity with the Commission.
It is still the institution that controls the operations of competition policy, the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the common transport policy.
We should also remember that some Member States, including my country, must hold a referendum on any Treaty changes that arise at the forthcoming IGC.
The loss of an automatic right to nominate a Commissioner would certainly be a very difficult, if not impossible, proposal to sell to an Irish electorate in this referendum.
I would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at European Council level.
The Council represents the interests of the 15 Member State governments within the institutional framework of the Union and currently, under existing EU Treaties, unanimous agreement of the 15 Member States is required for any tax changes sought within the Union.
The report we are discussing today seeks to extend qualified majority voting to all legislative activities except those of a constitutional nature.
I believe that national Member States should retain the right of veto on taxation matters.
The Irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates.
Mr President, whilst I too wish to express my dismay at the ongoing prejudice displayed towards Austria by 14 Member States, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which refers to a number of very important areas.
Most minority groups in Europe define themselves through their cultural traditions, and it will only be possible to afford them the protection they need if we make it possible for them to integrate into mainstream society, whilst respecting their own traditions.
If we are to acknowledge and comprehend these traditions, we will have to do more than register the differences purely as ethnic characteristics or as a list of discriminations.
In defining and reworking the concept of a minority' s culture, a new dimension will be added to this very important basis for identity, and cultural issues within the EU will not be treated as a mere colourful adjunct to our other very important responsibilities.
We are concerned by the proposals for constitutionalisation of the Union, by the proposals to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty, by the progressive diminishing of the distinction between the first and second pillars, by the proposal that the Council should adopt broad guidelines of economic, employment and social convergence policies by qualified majority.
These are just some examples of the complex and controversial issues which are raised.
It should ensure that it meets the deadline, to enable the first wave of enlargement to include Central and Eastern European countries by 2004, and to continue any further necessary reforms with the full inclusion of our new partners.
If the EU delays enlargement too long, it may make it more difficult, or impossible, for some candidate countries to join within the envisaged timetable.
The President-in-Office addressed some of these concerns in his speech.
I do not think that is a very fair reflection on the extraordinary reforms that many of the candidate countries have made in the last 9 and 10 years since they were within the Warsaw Pact or formerly part of the Soviet Union.
Our priority is enlargement.
Mr President, my group welcomes this report.
It sends a clear message to the IGC to be ambitious, to think long-term and not short-term, to think of how a Union with nearly double the number of Member States we have now can actually function effectively and to take this opportunity to change the Treaties, because future IGCs with nearly 30 states around the table will find it even more difficult than it is now to agree on reforms.
On the size of the Commission, for instance, the formulas that are likely to be adopted tomorrow will refer either to one Commissioner per Member State or to a smaller number, a fixed number of Commissioners.
The Commission cannot go on expanding indefinitely.
In the second case, it will be a rotating system, so that every Member State, large and small, has equal opportunities of seeing one of its nationals serve in the Commission.
On the question of the size of the European Parliament, we have also found a point of equilibrium, based on to a minimum number of Members for each Member State.
So the report is balanced and I think can be welcomed.
Some people are saying: ' The IGC will never agree to this point or to that point' .
That is essential for our future.
Unanimity voting must apply to decisions of a constitutional and fundamental nature.
Closer cooperation must make it possible to manage diversity and avoid getting bogged down, without calling the fundamental structure of the Union into question.
The Scottish National Party, which I represent, is committed in its manifesto and its general policy to the idea of Europe as a confederation of peoples, countries and regions, not as a sovereign federal union in its own right.
I want to draw attention particularly to Amendment No 138, in its interaction with paragraph 32 of the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report.
The reduction in Members of the European Parliament that we would face, coupled with the arrival of new Member States which are smaller in population than Scotland or Wales and which would be fully represented in all the institutions of the Union, will certainly increase the pressure for and our people' s commitment to the idea of our own independence in this great European confederation.
The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 1 to 4, 8, 11, 24, 35 to 38, 46, 48, 49 and 52 in principle, as far as they clarify the intention of the Commission to establish an efficient, transparent and balanced regulatory framework for GMOs.
Some of these amendments need only to be brought into line with the legal wording of the text of the directive and the overall legislative framework.
For other amendments, for instance those amendments concerning antibiotic-resistant marker genes, the principle is politically acceptable but the proposed text as such does not seem to be appropriate.
The Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 5 to 7, 10, 12 to 16, 18, 20 to 23, 25 to 28, 30 to 34, 39 to 45, 50 and 51.
More specifically concerning Amendments Nos 22, 23 and 25, the Commission cannot accept them as they stand but is willing to consider how due account can be taken of the concerns they reflect.
I have the Council' s common position of 9 December 1999 before me.
If I remember correctly, we were still under the Finnish Council Presidency in December 1999, with a Green Environment Minister.
The Green Group is not dependent on the positions of the Green ministers represented in the Environment Council.
But I wanted to speak specifically on the vote on Amendment No 37.
I think it is quite logical to vote on Amendment No 11 first, before Amendment No 37, because Amendment No 11 goes further than Amendment No 37.
It proposes a total ban on antibiotic-resistant marker genes, which is not the case in Amendment No 37, which relates only to Part C of the directive.
Mr Lannoye, the rapporteur discussed this question with the competent services yesterday.
In fact he believes that the wording of Amendment No 11 is such as to suggest a different voting order from the one you recommend.
After the vote on Amendments Nos 38 and 49: President.
But I also had to respect the protocol which, once again, unfortunately often takes precedence over our proceedings.
Let me assure you that all your comments will be passed on to the Bureau.
In paragraph 15, instead of saying "the OAU" it should say "the African States" .
In section 17, instead of "the OAU" it should say "Africa" .
Mr President, I am delighted this resolution has been adopted by Parliament in recognition of the problem that exists with additionality.
As Commissioner Barnier has stated, it is as important to comply with the spirit of additionality as with the letter of the law.
The Commissioner also endorsed the statement by Commissioner Liikanen that in future the Commission would be particularly attentive to the spending figures put forward by the Member States when there is evidence of reduced expenditure in a given region or regions.
Paragraph A continues to confuse the principle of additionality with the separate but equally important principle of co-financing.
Paragraph G is inaccurate.
Our real goal must be to plan and give our support to the successful implementation of these funds to improve the life prospects of people in our poorest regions.
My party is committed to this goal and will work with other parties in a constructive and positive way to achieve this.
Checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road Mr President, I voted for this resolution because, clearly, the transport of dangerous goods is constantly in need of regulation.
The experience of workers who have been performing this activity for a substantial period of time should be recognised, and employment of the elderly in all the most hazardous activities should be promoted.
Recommendation for second reading: Bowe (A5-0083/2000) President, we are very disappointed with the outcome of the vote.
If industry maintains that products of genetic engineering are safe and do not present risks, then I cannot understand why the majority of delegates have caved in and allowed industry to continue to evade responsibility.
A lame demand of this kind takes no account whatsoever of consumer interests.
Mr President, I want to give an oral explanation of vote because what has happened, once again, is not very good news for our Parliament.
This would mean that antibiotic-resistant products that have already been authorised would remain.
There are many less damaging forms of marker genes available and it is EU policy to prohibit all unnecessary use of antibiotics if there is a risk for human or animal health.
The directive should take a clear stand and insist that the use of these marker genes is stopped now.
The Environment Committee adopted two contradictory amendments, one for a total exemption and one tightening up the common position line of a conditional exemption with all the normal environmental risk provisions.
Admittedly, we have known since first reading that the principle of banning GMOs, or at least having a moratorium to allow for more in-depth studies, was rejected.
Alas, as we already know from the White Paper it prepared on the subject, the Commission is not in favour of compulsory insurance in this area.
The pressure groups in the biotechnology industry explain that there is no risk, while at the same time saying that compulsory insurance is impossible because the risk is not insurable.
One obscure aspect of this business is that the French Government which, according to the most recent information, includes ecologists, had officially expressed reservations about this Amendment No 33.
As a consumer, I am very pleased about this compulsory labelling because it will allow us to make an informed choice, although I would have preferred stricter rules that required a very clear indication on the outside packaging!
Yet this is a positive first step, since it has led several large firms to stop putting GMOs into their products.
The proposals of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy set out a strict and transparent framework, thus responding fully to consumer concerns.
The purpose of the three main amendments I support is as follows: to prevent any accidental contamination of fields by cross-pollination between GMO and non-GMO crops.
However, as proposed by the rapporteur, the amendments approved at first reading but not accepted by the Council must now be included.
We also support the defence of total environmental liability as it is unacceptable not to force companies in the biotechnology sector to take the necessary measures to protect human health and minimise environmental risks.
As a Swedish Christian Democrat Member of the European Parliament, I want to state that it must never be the GMO industry and economic interests which are allowed to govern legislation and regulations.
In purely practical terms, this means regulations which guarantee a minimised risk of the spread of GMOs, a halt to the use of antibiotic resistance markers, an increase in independent research into the risks presented by GMOs, liability for damages based on the principle that those who release GMOs into the environment with deleterious effects upon health or the environment should be held strictly liable, long-term evaluations of the socio-economic and environmental consequences of the release of GMOs into the environment, permanent labelling of GMO products, compliance with all current regulations, such as the Biosafety Protocol, and an open application and decision-making process in which the public are entitled to express an opinion and in which each application is dealt with separately and no simplified application procedures are approved. - (SV) It is an important report which Parliament has voted on today.
The Directive guarantees a high level of protection.
In the case of genes expressing resistance to antibiotics, the Council' s position makes continued research possible under strict conditions based upon environmental considerations and respect for the consumer.
Labour Euro MPs have been at the forefront of protecting our citizens and our environment.
We have consistently backed proposals to ensure that the use of GMOs and products derived from GMOs are strictly controlled within the EU.
David Bowe' s report is yet further proof of Europe greening up its act and putting the safety of our citizens first.
Papayannakis report (A5-0088/2000) Mr President, I voted for the measure on the labelling of beef.
All too often, the governments of our 15 States think of citizens, particularly pensioners and the elderly, as numbers, people without an identity, a life story or a date of birth.
It is quite astounding that, given the gravity of the situation, today, so many years after the crisis, we still do not have an effective system of traceability in place.
Indeed we also defended that point of view by tabling amendments in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The Committee on the Environment amended important points of the Commission proposal.
Pushing for clear labelling is the only way to convince our customers that food safety is top of our list.
Lisbon European Council Mr President, I have taken the floor, for the last time today, to explain the way I voted on the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit.
With regard to social security, I would have preferred it if the decision had, at last, been taken to create a single European pension for the Union.
In fact, a new wave of neo-liberalism swept through Lisbon and gave the EU its marching orders in the global economic war.
And this was done with the complicity of all the left-wing governments present in Lisbon.
To sugar the pill, the EU is promising us quasi-general access to the Internet and cutting-edge vocational training.
In addition, it will be capable of improving citizens' quality of life and the environment.
However, it is equally true that without active intervention this shift will widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.
These thoughts are reflected in our votes and the amendments tabled. - (EL) The Lisbon Summit, which can only euphemistically be termed "an Employment Summit" despite the clamorous declarations that went with it, achieved no more than to take another step towards changing employment into employability, redefining the concept 'working person' and destabilising labour relations and rights, to serve the celebrated 'New Economy' in the best possible way for big business, this being the new name for the old, familiar but still more unrestrained and harsh economic and social liberalism.
What the Lisbon economic and social policy guidelines are promoting, what is in practice being prepared for working people and 'served up' under a misnamed 'modernisation' - intended to 'sugar the pill' , deceive working people and reduce public reaction against the anti-labour and anti-grass roots economic and social policy of the EU - is a minimum level of poverty and not a minimum level of prosperity.
You will find them in front of you, unsubdued, uncompromising and unyielding, fighting for and demanding full and steady employment and a system of social policy that includes insurance, health, pensions, protection for the unemployed, real equality of opportunity, quality education and substantive professional training.
We express our solidarity with these African peoples who have paid a heavy price to our ruling classes; and it is not even enough for us to cancel a debt that has already been largely repaid.
Yet the EU persists in wanting to divide Africa between the Mediterranean area and black Africa.
Although the Africans have managed to wrest a few promises of debt cancellation from a few EU countries, the EU remains opposed to the idea of a global cancellation of the third world debt, which means the people are starving daily.
Like the EU-Africa civil society Forum in March, which brought together more than 80 NGOs, we declare our opposition to the structural adjustment programmes and our continued support for the debt-cancellation campaigns.
As a Portuguese person and as an MEP, I regret that the Portuguese presidency has confused the position which it took as a government in its bilateral relations with Austria with the responsibilities which it must assume and fulfil when holding the Council presidency.
As we were all here, apart from one political group which was also absent from a certain point, I must regret that the Portuguese presidency chose to align itself with a political group which has the most recent totalitarian memories in this House.
She represents this institution and must act and speak in this House with respect for all the different positions expressed here.
However, if I were asked to give my opinion on the overall status of the situation in Europe, I would have to say that I am somewhat confused and concerned.
Personally, I find some of the decisions adopted extremely excessive, if not rash, such as, for example, the proposal to open the Community to Turkey - a country which I respect and which it is right to respect, despite its differences from the European Community in terms of history, culture and politics and the concept of the State as well, quite apart from the issue of human rights - and these decisions are evidence of an organisation which is becoming increasingly more economic than political.
The Europe which we Europeanists dream of is a Europe of States, and it should therefore be no cause for concern to anyone who, and rightly so, believes strongly in national identity.
There is no point in denying anything in this case either.
I feel that Parliament will be required to take courageous, decisive action in matters much more important than a resolution, if, as I fear, the agenda is not extended, and if, in the end, as the current state of affairs would suggest, an excess of caution results in a Conference which makes nothing more than cosmetic changes to the Treaties and avoids any substantial modifications.
The integration of the financial perspectives into the Treaty will thereby be a medium-term financial plan which will be agreed between Parliament and the Council.
Let us remember that the financial perspectives procedure has brought budgetary stability to the European Union.
Nevertheless, Parliament believes that the integration of the financial perspectives into the Treaty will mean that, as well as stability, there will be sufficient flexibility to allow for a review of those perspectives when necessary.
This confusion will lead to conflict year after year.
With regard to the classification of expenditure, which this House has also long wanted to see, we must find an institutional point of balance which combines the European Parliament' s requests for a greater degree of codecision in budgetary matters with the defence of the privileged nature of certain expenditure which forms the basis of the European Union' s economic and social cohesion.
However, let us remember that, if what we want is an autonomous financial system for the Union, we must at the same time create a fair tax system.
Sooner or later we will have to be sufficiently progressive in terms of own resources as a basis for this fair tax system.
I am convinced that this opportunity for representatives of the national parliaments of both the Union countries and the candidate countries to meet and discuss future strategies and the implications of the Intergovernmental Conference is extremely valuable and must not be passed up.
There is an excellent resolution on the table which refers to the many necessary reforms.
Cooperation should be more flexible and each Member State must retain a Commissioner.
If the European governments do not change their attitudes soon, a treaty will be drawn up in Nice which guarantees to cripple the Union once it has been enlarged.
First number: 700.
Limiting the number of Members of the European Parliament to 700 would not be a cause for concern were it not that it would render our Parliament less representative.
We must reaffirm that it is our Parliament' s prime and absolute task to represent the people and the peoples of Europe in all their diversity.
Second number: two thirds.
If a simple majority is good enough for the investment of the Commission, then the same majority should suffice for a vote of no confidence.
The report proposes the year 2009 as the date for electing MEPs from transnational lists.
Now this is a case of either or: either our Parliament decides this measure is not a good one, which would mean abandoning it - even in 2009 - or, like the Greens, it must admit that such lists are vital if we want to create real families of thought in Europe, in which case this important political debate can begin by the time of the 2004 elections.
This timid IGC 2000 can in no way represent an end result, but only the first step towards a constitution.
We have a framework agreed between nations and not one imposed on the nations.
This would be a disaster for my own country, Portugal, as for other smaller or medium-sized Member States.
Today' s statement by President-in-Office of the Council Gama has inspired me with a little more confidence, but I still see no evidence of political will on the part of the other Member States.
Extending majority voting in the Council must lead to codecision rights for the European Parliament.
I would like to ask the Council how it proposes to pull off the stroke of excluding a certain Member State from taking part in discussions without any legal basis, when it needs this State' s support in order to achieve unanimity in the Council on Treaty amendments.
I cannot support the proposal in recital 29 of the report to make the procedure for suspending a Member State easier.
How I vote at tomorrow' s vote on this resolution will depend on the outcome of the vote on these issues.
Madam President, the IGC should prepare the EU for the reorganisation needed to bring about the complete process of enlargement that is in hand.
It is important that the report proposes that closer cooperation should be facilitated.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has recommended that the principle of flexibility should also be realised in the form of greater scope for cooperation for those countries that cannot or do not want to accept the Union' s statutes in their entirety.
In making its review the Group of the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party states that flexibility might lead to a larger concentric Europe, composed of a federal core and a less integrated outer circle.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what are the issues at stake in this Intergovernmental Conference?
Manifestly, the first and main issue is the quality of the decision-making process in the Union.
But we have to acknowledge that undoubtedly we will also need this instrument.
That is what this Parliament said when it first stated its position and I think that in a way we have helped persuade the community of Heads of State and Government to listen to our refrain.
But today I want to address those MEPs who see, behind this closer cooperation, the risk of too far-reaching consultation between the large countries.
To that end, let us authorise closer cooperation when one third of the Member States takes part or is involved, and let us authorise this closer cooperation by a qualified majority, after obtaining Parliament' s assent.
However, the majority of my Conservative colleagues have voted to reject the report and will vote accordingly in this House.
The Conservative delegation regards many of the ideas in the report as centralising, syndicalist, unnecessary and backward-looking.
That is the nature of democracy and democratic decisions.
Madam President, the report by the two rapporteurs is very ambitious, very ahead of the times, but it has two major defects, which ought to be corrected by the vote in plenary.
Firstly, to generalise the system of dual simple majority voting is not the panacea of the future integration of Europe.
A principle of that kind could induce public opinion in the Member States and the national parliaments to reject that system for the most sensitive issues which are in fact exceptions to the general rule.
The underlying principle of "one man - one vote" is unacceptable.
It conflicts with Article 190 of the Treaty which provides that the number of elected Members must ensure the appropriate representation of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community.
On the contrary, if we want decisions proposed on the Commission' s initiative to gain wide support in all the Member States, it is vital for them all to be represented.
The important vote we will be holding tomorrow will, I hope, enable the European Parliament to put an end to this ambiguity and to make some adjustments.
Only a more politically realistic proposal will have a chance of being taken into consideration.
Madam President, at a time when the future of the European Union depends more than ever on the balance and smooth functioning of our institutions, I want to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos and Jo Leinen, for the high quality of their work.
We all agree today that we must adopt institutional and political reforms prior to any enlargement of the Union.
The time has come for Europe to be a power capable of genuine political expression, of sustaining a social project and framing a common foreign and defence policy.
But Europe will only be democratic if the people themselves determine the principles and rules of its organisation.
I am happy that the Dimitrakopoulos report takes this aspiration into account in the framework of a constitutional process aimed at simplifying and clarifying the Community treaties.
Commissioner, I hope the representatives of the Member States will embark on real reforms and take the measure of the issues at stake in the Intergovernmental Conference, so as to make this century into the century of Europe.
After all, the IGC should prepare the Union for enlargement, and this enlargement will require the current Member States to make sacrifices.
In addition, it should, of course, bring Europe closer to its citizens, because the distance between Brussels and our citizens is still far too great.
Simply reducing a democratic deficit is not sufficient to improve contact with the citizen.
This is provided for in Amendment No 162.
Once enlargement has taken place, closer cooperation could do a great service to a Union containing a still greater diversity of Member States within its borders.
To read the text of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, you would almost believe that the European federalists have already won the day: a Commission that does not contain representatives from every Member State, a Parliament in which even the representatives of the medium-sized States no longer carry any weight, and a Council that essentially bases its majorities on 51% of the total population of the Member States.
The text we adopt tomorrow will, I hope, be a different one, a more balanced text that is geared to continuing teamwork between large and small States, and which continues to respect the distinguishing features of our European peoples and States, and therefore does not make even more demands of the citizens of Europe, who have enough problems with the degree of centralisation in Brussels as it is.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen put forward a proposal in recital 29 to modify the procedure for suspending a Member State in the event of serious democratic and human rights violations.
Therefore let us dispense with hypocritical amendments to Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty.
It is important that each country should have a Member in the Commission.
The Commission must therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the Member States.
It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civil and military cooperation.
A European military alliance should not, therefore, be created within the framework of the EU' s institutions but between individual States.
Finally, I want to thank the rapporteurs for a very good report and to express my hope that the Citizens' Charter will usher in the new Treaty.
We have to strike a balance between efficiency, democracy and Member State equality.
Above all, we have to be able to restore confidence of our citizens in decision making in the European Union.
The balance between the small and the large Member States must also be preserved in the Council so that double majority voting can never be acceptable under any circumstances.
Madam President, the constitutional questions we are debating today are highly controversial, as the vote in committee clearly shows.
In fact 12 Members voted for and 12 voted against.
But I find it reassuring that so many Members agreed that the length of the shopping list of proposals contained in the report' s 52 paragraphs and 58 sub-paragraphs is exaggerated and that, as things stand, there is a risk that the Intergovernmental Conference will not take it seriously.
I want to dissociate myself from demands such as that we should cut my country' s delegation in the European Parliament by one third.
With 6 Members it is materially impossible to follow up all the dossiers that are crucial to our country.
It is easier to divide up the work and to specialise in a large delegation: even if the largest delegation, comprising 99 Members, was reduced by a third, they would still be able to share out the work.
For the time being, it is enough to propose that the seats in the European Parliament should be allotted on the basis of a degressive proportional system, with a minimum number of seats per Member State, while of course respecting Article 190 of the Treaty.
In the case of a qualified-majority Council decision, it is inconceivable to provide for a simple majority of Member States.
We must have a majority of two thirds of the Member States, even if that means providing at the same time for a simple majority of Member States representing a majority of the total EU population.
There can be no question of restricting unanimous Council voting to decisions of a constitutional nature.
I hope the idea of not allocating one Commissioner to each Member State is well and truly dead.
Finally, if we really need closer cooperation, it must involve at least half of the Member States, otherwise we risk ending up with something like the French Directory.
This document contains other incongruities too, especially in relation to the budget, which fortunately have no chance of success in the Council and even less chance of being ratified by national parliaments that have any self-respect.
Madam President, I wonder which of these is more serious: what the Council has done by means of an intergovernmental method, once again, to reform the Treaties and an extraordinarily limited agenda for this IGC, bearing in mind the challenges facing us, or the report that we are going to adopt tomorrow in this House.
I believe that our report is more serious.
They are consistent with what this Parliament has always demanded: more democracy and efficiency for the European Union.
Furthermore, in this respect, I believe that the effort of the rapporteurs in drawing up the original draft and seeking a compromise through the amendments will lead to a position which should be taken into account by this Parliament and by the national governments.
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency at the moment, and ask certain governments - I am not going to say which ones - to be a little bit more generous when it comes to European construction.
Madam President, enlargement and its strategic, political and economic consequences for the European Union cannot remain issues undiscussed by the public or viewed exclusively from the national perspective.
This is why the debate caused by the presentation of the European Parliament' s position on this promising Intergovernmental Conference is vital in understanding this new phase of European construction which is both risky and open to question.
We are pleased that this contribution from Parliament stresses, as the main themes and guiding principles, the democratisation, efficiency and greater supervision of the European institutions, exactly where the respective deficits have been most felt and where the risks of disintegration, caused by the significant increase in the number of Member States, were greatest.
We fortunately have the opportunity to improve these points tomorrow in plenary.
In my opinion, the grounding of the European project in the dual legitimacy of a union of peoples and a union of States is not reflected in the end result of this report' s proposals.
At a time when the European Parliament should be achieving a consensus which could act as an important reference, politically speaking, for the Intergovernmental Conference, our position is cause for regret.
I would also encourage you to ensure that the IGC agenda is extended to questions which we regard as essential, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I am also grateful for the many suggestions put forward for the report compiled by myself and Mr Dimitrakopoulos.
Our role is to be the driving force behind further European unification, and that is the spirit in which this parliamentary report, which we are to vote on tomorrow, has been compiled.
I believe we have struck a balance between Europe of the States and Europe of the citizens.
Therefore I hope that this Intergovernmental Conference will use the opportunity to at last restore the balance between the two institutions, Parliament and the Council that is, and to give Parliament more powers.
I too feel that it is extremely important to strike a balance between the large and small countries.
There will be far more small countries than large countries in the enlarged Union.
We have an excellent report for voting on tomorrow.
Comments were made about the Council' s absence during the address by the Austrian President to this Parliament.
There is a clear boundary around the work of the Portuguese presidency with regard to the functioning of the institutions and the role of Austria in these institutions.
This was totally obvious from my intervention in this House when this issue was first debated.
Within the European Union we have met all the requirements allowing Austria to act and participate fully in the European institutions and in their own functioning as a country.
We are therefore not confusing any of our positions and we refuse, due to a mere internal political provocation, to consider in this debate issues which have nothing to do with the European Parliament and the European institutions.
As I pointed out this morning, they have sought the greatest possible convergence between the Commission and the European Parliament, in order to imbue these negotiations with the political impetus they need.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to make three comments at the conclusion of this debate.
Firstly, many speakers discussed the question of the equilibrium between what are termed the large and the small states.
The first option is one Commissioner per Member State on a permanent basis, all sitting at the same time, but with a Commission which will one day have 30 or 35 Commissioners, which will inevitably mean a hierarchy within the College.
The second option is a Commission with one Commissioner per Member State, but not all sitting at the same time, which would mean the Commission would remain more collegiate by nature.
That, ladies and gentlemen, remains our aim: to establish an equilibrium between the small and the large states.
Second concern: the role of the European Parliament as the driving force, as referred to by Jo Leinen.
As I said this morning, I really believe that we, and you, ladies and gentlemen, during your term of office, must spend some time explaining these European issues not just in your constituencies, your countries, but everywhere else too, to all the citizens, and as often as possible.
President Napolitano proposed the idea of an interparliamentary conference.
Of course we know that history will not stop at the end of the year 2000 and that there will be further institutional changes.
There is no way that later, when we have 20, 25 or 30 Member States, we will be able to do what we did not manage to do either in Amsterdam or today, this year, for lack of political will.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Within the international community, either individually or through the European Union as a whole, the European countries have made an important contribution.
This intervention is very important in tackling the problem of nearly 16 million people currently at risk throughout this area.
At this precise moment, the Executive Director of the World Food Programme is in Addis Ababa for discussions with the Ethiopian Government on this issue, which involves technical and practical problems in transporting the food.
We cannot separate from this issue the current political and military position in Ethiopia.
However, these concerns are the centre of attention not only for the Commission but also for the Council.
Unfortunately, sometimes we cannot react as rapidly as we would like to the various situations of humanitarian need and shortage.
I am standing in for my colleague, Commissioner Nielson, who would have liked to have been able to respond himself.
So we improve our capacity to deal with the humanitarian problems in spite of the difficulties.
The Ethiopian Government has asked for 821 000 tonnes of food aid, 25% more than in recent years.
Let me also correct an inaccuracy that is circulating as a result of an Oxfam statement which claimed that the Commission provided only 50 000 tonnes to Ethiopia last year.
During that time nearly 40% of our total aid to Ethiopia has been in food assistance or food security programmes: some EUR 875 million' s worth, EUR 250 million in the last four years alone.
I hope that letter gets wider circulation.
One of the things that she said in her letter - and I guess she speaks with almost more authority on this subject than anyone else - is: "The European Union, together with Member States, remains the biggest donor of food aid to Ethiopia" .
We will continue to devote our full attention to this crisis until it is over, and our people in ECHO on the ground will continue to work tirelessly to get help to where it is needed.
We are looking urgently for alternatives, including better use of the Port of Berbera through rapid improvements to the road from Berbera into Ethiopia.
It is intensely frustrating that as millions starve, governments spend small fortunes on guns and weaponry to wage war against each other when the only war they should be waging is a war against starvation, a war for food security, a war against poverty and environmental degradation, a war in which we are morally bound to help them.
Once again, we have pop stars and celebrities criticising the institutions of Europe and national governments for doing too little too late.
It is amazing how quickly some people become experts when a situation like this arises and they can see some publicity, without knowing more of the background to the overall position.
We must watch the situation in Eritrea and balance humanitarian aid there, if required.
I recently spent a week in both Ethiopia and Eritrea.
I saw children with serious malnutrition and in need of health care, as well as food and proper shelter.
We never seem to learn a lesson from the past.
Put a freeze on the military trade, try to reach a peace agreement and meanwhile, deploy your military lorry capacity and manpower where they are needed.
The Organisation of African Unity and the European Union must exert maximum pressure on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea to settle their dispute in Algiers, and aid workers must gain safe access to the population without delay.
All we do is try to put the fire out with occasional aid, without a clear or decisive policy for prevention although we know perfectly well that famine in Africa, and in the third world in general, happens periodically.
The gravity of the situation and the need for our solidarity with these people to result in exceptional and priority action lead me finally to ask the Commission, and particularly Commissioners Patten and Nielson, to keep us regularly and closely informed about how the situation is developing and especially the measures which they intend to use or are developing to ease this situation.
Mr President, the Ethiopian government has blamed the international community for not being sufficiently alert in its aid efforts to feed its hungry population.
The donors, including the European Union, are said not to have kept their promises.
Misplaced because this statement is made by a government which has been embroiled in an absurd war over borders with its neighbour, Eritrea, for two years now.
Mr President, famine and Ethiopia: these are two words sadly etched in our memories.
In the Horn of Africa, which has become the site of every conceivable scourge, 16 million victims of famine, of which 8 million are in Ethiopia, are awaiting aid.
Nonetheless, in a region torn apart by a rearguard conflict, this crisis leaves a particularly bitter taste, because every penny paid to buy a gun, to buy ammunition, aggravates an already precarious economic, social and nutritional situation.
We must demand that Eritrea and Ethiopia freeze their military activities so that all the assets, all the logistical and human capabilities of these countries are put at the service of their peoples.
Mr President, misery and death in Ethiopia were on our screens four years ago.
The cameramen left but misery and death did not leave Ethiopia.
Famine, disease and death remain the hallmarks of these countries.
I accept the difficulties of the logistics but that means less than a kilo per person.
No time limit is given, in other words it is a kilo that has to last forever.
These measures are palliative.
Commissioner Patten' s words made clear not only an objective awareness of the work already carried out but also an absolute awareness that this situation is intolerable and that the European Commission will be determined on this issue, that it will take specific action and also closely monitor future developments.
As for the Council, I should like to say that there is great interest in ensuring that situations of this kind can be permanently followed and monitored in close coordination with the Commission.
It is important that an objective awareness is created within the European Union that humanitarian issues must be dealt with in an increasingly committed manner and that the European Union and its Member States must, within the relevant international organisations, ensure priority attention for these issues.
Dialogue with the African authorities is essential, as is dialogue with the sub-regional authorities.
If we cannot organise the international community within the global international organisations and within the more regional organisations, we will not have any response to all the crises which are systematically affecting the weakest countries in particular.
Thank you very much Minister.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
It would seem far more logical to give this leading role to the European Commission, notably Commissioner Patten, to implement this Stability Pact promptly and efficiently. . (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, on his excellent and important report.
Between 1991 and 1999, the total aid from the EU to South-Eastern Europe, including that from the EU as a whole and the Member States individually, was in excess of EUR 19.3 billion.
The Lisbon European Council confirmed that our overall objective remains the greatest possible integration of the countries in the region within Europe' s political and economic system.
As a result, the rapporteur concludes that it will be necessary to create a type of medium-term stabilisation and regional development programme.
Most of the countries already benefit from trade preferences and the Lisbon Special European Council confirmed that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be preceded by greater asymmetric trade liberalisation thereby specifically favouring these countries in their bilateral trade with EU countries.
The idea underlying the stabilisation and association process is sufficiently broad and flexible to ensure a constant project in this area.
As with other comprehensive agreements, we therefore hope to be able to establish interim agreements covering the period between the signature and ratification of these agreements, bearing in mind that normally almost twenty months pass between these two events.
It is also worthwhile to remember that we already have contractual relations in the form of trade and cooperation agreements with Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Bearing in mind the request made by the local authorities, Bosnia-Herzegovina was sent a guide whose use will help towards preparing a viability study on negotiations for an agreement of the same type.
This work is moving forward at a good pace given, of course, that in this specific case, we must be careful and not create excessive expectations, as the reality of the situation there does not allow us to be overly optimistic in this respect.
The rapporteur also refers briefly to the Stability Pact on which we have been cooperating with these five countries and with the countries involved in the enlargement process.
We believe that reciprocal commitment is the key to the Pact' s success and I feel that this point was made very clear in the recent discussions at the Commission and World Bank conference.
The commitment of the countries in the region to implement institutional policy reforms and to create an environment allowing economic progress is a fundamental element in this Pact.
In return, the international community is supporting the reform commitments and the donors and financial institutions have promised or mobilised a total of EUR 2.4 billion.
Of this amount, the European Union alone, that is, the Commission and Member States combined, have promised or mobilised EUR 1.08 billion.
The international community has financed in particular a quick-start package of EUR 1.8 billion announced at the conference and has made available the necessary financing to accelerate the preparation and implementation of projects and initiatives in the short-term package.
In the meeting of 20 March, the Council invited the Commission to work on a proposal and to present this to the Council with a view to including Montenegro in the Agency' s mandate.
Finally, the Council has invited the Secretary-General and High Representative, under the authority of the Council presidency and in full cooperation with the Commission, to ensure the coherence of the policies for the Western Balkans.
The donor conference had a positive outcome, at least on paper.
We could have, and in fact should have, made a start on them in the autumn.
However, the wars in the region were more expensive in every respect than all the necessary measures will prove to be.
The idea of having a Stability Pact is a sound one because it is geared primarily towards cross-border measures, and thus to prevention of conflicts.
However, stability in the region depends to a large extent in most spheres on the eradication of criminal power structures and the construction of structures befitting a state under the rule of law, as is the case in Bosnia for example.
The parties of Karadzic and Kraijnik gained the most support.
They have tolerated, or even promoted, parallel structures for too long.
Efforts to initiate and undertake judicial reform, in Bosnia for example, are in a state of disarray.
Mr President, the report on the stabilisation and association process for the countries in eastern Europe we are debating today attempts, and I believe successfully so, to formulate a stable political framework with which to address the Balkan tragedy.
Secondly: the boundaries of the states in the area are non-negotiable, even if it proves necessary in critical cases to adopt flexible forms of administrative autonomy and greater decentralisation.
Positive results will emerge through development, democracy and prosperity.
I hope that the strong convergence of support for the Lagendijk report achieved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs will find the same response in Parliament, and thereby express the desire of us all for a positive and stable outcome.
It is in fact the case that a gender task force has been established under working party 1, but this has not happened because of any initiative from above but because of an initiative from below when a number of women have - if I may put it like this - approached the conference table and asked if it were not unreasonable for them, in one way or another, to have a central place in the whole of the reconstruction work.
It is a number of quite concrete, down-to-earth things these women have proposed, such as developing a proper programme for women and involving women in the general development plans.
For the moment, I will just note that the Pact' s real aim is to ensure the political and economic dependence of the countries in the area, to plunder their wealth and to overexploit their workforce.
And the question is this: what principle of international law are they basing their actions on?
Firstly, the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe focuses on regional cooperation in the Balkans.
Secondly, I consider Paragraph 26 in the Lagendijk report to be a fine idea.
We had a discussion on Macedonia recently - I had the opportunity to draft a report on this, and would again like to thank those of you who supported me - in fact we were debating a stabilisation and association agreement.
But there is a new government and attitudes towards the refugee situation, economic development and, in particular, Europe, have changed.
If we have a few cornerstones of regional development, such as Macedonia, Croatia, and hopefully also Albania soon, then it will be possible to create a network of stability in South-Eastern Europe.
There is a final point I would particularly like to address: the donor conference, which was highly successful - I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council, but I would particularly like to thank the Commissioner, both of whom helped to make the donor conference a success - concentrated above all on material infrastructure, and indeed that is what we need in South-Eastern Europe.
The European Union must conclude that it should respect the frontiers in the Balkans, and that is something quite different from its attitude towards Milosevic.
We have States such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania in which the State is scarcely functioning, and then the two decisive challenges, namely Yugoslavia, or Serbia, where it is a question of doing everything we can to foster democratisation and develop a long-term strategy for the Europeanisation of Serbia.
Secondly, Kosovo, where we will never achieve success unless elected political structures come into being there, along with a long-term vision of what is to happen to this region, which will never again be a Serbian province.
But that is not the only factor adversely affecting the Stability Pact, it is also suffering from a lack of credibility on the part of the international organisations and also the European Union, which owing to a confusion of competences, wastage, and mismanagement, are displaying traits that would be dismissed as being typical of the Balkans, were it not for the fact that this is happening in our own organisations.
We are losing a great deal in the way of credit and respect in this region, and this respect and credibility are fundamentally even more important than the promises of funding that are made and then not kept.
I truly believe we must put this situation in order in the European Union, primarily by strengthening the Commission' s role in the matter.
Secondly, it should be borne in mind that the regional approach is appropriate and important, and that it is important for the European Union to play a guiding role throughout this matter.
Finally, I would like to mention two other points: the former Yugoslavia and crime.
Puglia, for example, is a region which has to tackle crime organisations with a base in our country as well as elsewhere.
It is fair to say that our work for the Lisbon Council was very much motivated by the strong feeling that unless we can make a success of our efforts in the Balkans, the whole credibility of our attempts to construct a common foreign and security policy will be shattered.
It is enormously important that we rise to the challenge in the Balkans.
A point we made to the heads of government in Lisbon in our report - which was very much reflected in the week that I spent recently in the region - is that the stabilisation and association process has to be at the heart of our strategy.
Unfortunately, given the fact that our budget is based on commitments and payments, and not just payments unlike the budgets in almost all the Member States, that is a particularly important factor.
We are not just talking about infrastructure in terms of hardware, we must also talk about infrastructure in terms of software.
That includes the rule of law, democratisation, the sort of civil society projects to which the honourable gentleman was referring; and it includes education - a point I will come back to in a moment.
I announced yesterday agreement in the Commission on a rapid reaction facility.
We will be coming forward to Parliament in the next few months with our new regulation for assistance to the West Balkans, which I hope will make it more rapid, more flexible and will, of course, have to include sufficient funding for projects supporting gender issues.
I can think of no single model of successful economic or political development which does not include at its heart sensible programmes to ensure that women can develop their full potential and play a full role in their communities.
I hope we are at last going to see more progress on the cleaning up of the Danube, which is crucial for the region.
Finally, the honourable Member asked about the scale of our financial commitments to the Balkans.
This year we will be spending about EUR 540m in the western Balkans.
It must be said that it does not involve huge increases in expenditure elsewhere but we have to provide support in a country like Croatia where there is a good and decent government trying to do a difficult job in extremely problematic circumstances.
My final point: we are clearly talking in the Balkans about building peace and security, not just in our backyard but in our front yard too.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Question Time (Council) The next item is Question Time (B5-0216/2000).
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 1, 2 and 3 will be taken together.
Question No 1 by (H-0255/00): Subject: Flagrant violation by Turkey of the rule of law and human rights The leader of the People' s Democracy Party of Turkey, together with 17 other members of the party' s leadership, has been sentenced to a three-year and nine months' term of imprisonment for supporting the hunger strike that took place in solidarity with Abdullah Öcalan when he was handed over to the Turkish secret services in Kenya.
Question No 2 by (H-0286/00): Subject: Human rights violations by Turkey In December 1999 Turkey became a candidate country for accession to the European Union.
Article 10 of the conclusions of the Helsinki Council Presidency states that Turkey must fulfil the general accession criteria, and in particular the Copenhagen criteria, if it is to become a Member of the European Union.
Turkey was named by the Helsinki European Council as a candidate country for accession to the European Union.
This status places Turkey in absolutely the same position as any other candidate country in terms of both obligations and benefits.
Turkey is therefore currently involved in a process in which its situation must be assessed in light of the criteria of the Copenhagen European Council.
This accession partnership will define the priority areas for reform on which the European Union considers that Turkey must concentrate its efforts in order to comply, hopefully in a progressive, capable and complete manner, with the Copenhagen criteria.
It is no mere chance that on the next day Turkey' s leaders declared that Turkey has become a candidate for accession without attached conditions.
With regard to defining the pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership, Turkey' s problems will certainly be paid close attention, particularly in terms of respect for the basic criteria of acting in accordance with European standards.
But that cannot happen.
You see, Belgrade can be bombed, but not Moscow, Beijing or Ankara.
If there is no question, the Council is not obliged to answer, only to listen, as you know, Mr Seixas da Costa.
I recommend to all of you that you begin with the question before making a declaration.
Secondly, would the Council be prepared, in this whole process, to suspend or cancel obligations of the European Union relating to the pre-accession process as long as the people we are talking about remain in prison?
We must draw from this the appropriate conclusions about how the development in the Turkish position on the Cypriot issue may also affect the development of the Turkish position in its approximation towards the European Union.
On such a delicate issue as the interpretation of a serious situation, like the development in the Cypriot situation and Turkey' s approximation towards the European Union, we must be very careful in our choice of words.
However, I feel that I made it clear that there is a direct link between Turkey' s approximation process and its position on the Cypriot issue.
Question No 4 by (H-0294/00): Subject: Blatant persecution and violation of the rights of the Assyrian-Chaldeans in Turkey Tens of thousands of Assyrian-Chaldeans in Turkey living in the south-east of the country have found refuge in Member States of the EU after being persecuted by the Turkish Government which has destroyed many of their homes, closed and raised to the ground their churches and banned the use of their language and teaching in this language.
They do have a human rights dimension which obviously must be tackled - and we will be vigilant in this respect - but they are essentially administrative.
The Council will be vigilant and the Commission will also raise these issues during the pre-accession negotiations.
Mr President-in-Office, I cannot say your answer is satisfactory.
We are talking here about two very ancient peoples who have been subjected to systematic genocide by the Turkish regime, a genocide perhaps not so impressive as in Armenia, but just as effective.
I would like to ask whether you can be more specific.
Question No 5 by (H-0262/00): Subject: Renewed tension in Kosovo The results of the 'peaceful' intervention by NATO forces in Kosovo are generally acknowledged to be deplorable.
The Council accepts the urgent need to find a solution to the continued outbreaks of ethnic violence, particularly against the Serbs, gypsies and other non-Albanian communities in Kosovo.
The Council has urged all the political leaders in Kosovo to adopt urgent measures to combat the escalation of violence, to reject expressions of extremism and to support UNMIK and KFOR.
It is very important that the Council manages to further develop the progress already made in the reconciliation between the ethnic groups and that Resolution 1244 can be put into practice.
We are committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence in Kosovo.
Only responsibility-sharing by representatives of the minorities can lead to the construction of a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
We should all ask ourselves whether everyone, particularly within Kosovo itself, is interested in the existence of a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
The Council places great importance on the careful preparation by UNMIK and the OSCE of local elections to be held this year, including the provisions on voting by absentees and the participation of minorities.
In terms of supporting this process of democratisation and coexistence, the European Union has been working together with other international partners to re-establish daily life for the whole of Kosovo' s population, whatever their ethnic background.
In addition to the important bilateral assistance given by the Member States, the European Community has allocated humanitarian aid for 1999 to 2000 to the amount of EUR 429 million for the Kosovar refugees, displaced persons within the country and those returning home.
The aid for reconstruction and the special financial assistance, including the support for UNMIK, will total EUR 437 million between 1999 and 2000.
Unfortunately, at times the practical efficiency of these actions is not sufficient to end an unstable situation beset by tensions which we hope will decrease in the future.
Mr Alavanos, I believe it was clear from what I said and in fact you recognised yourself that the general objective of the European Union and the international community is to respect the terms of Security Council Resolution 1244, particularly on the establishment of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.
I believe that Lisbon, the ancient Olisipo, was founded by Ulysses.
We must realise that the international community' s position, which is not brilliant in terms of the practical application of these measures, is the only one which can resolve a conflict on which the international community was only called to act due to the total inability to find a solution within the Former Yugoslavia.
It was precisely the situation created in the Former Yugoslavia which caused this reaction.
The problem now facing us is to try and ensure that the structures created outside the democratic process, simply because this did not exist in the Former Yugoslavia, allow an approach of solely political action to be adopted in a democratic Kosovo.
We will try to continue exerting pressure in this respect and we believe that renewing in some way the institutional organisation of civil society through independent elections may contribute significantly to this stability.
This mandate also includes the development of a phased economic recovery plan.
This means that the individual cases mentioned in the Member' s question should be dealt with directly by the UN Secretary-General' s Special Representative for Kosovo, who is responsible for the territorial administration of Kosovo, or by the Foreign Minister of the Member State in which the undertakings are established.
The Council assumes general political responsibility for the EU' s participation in UNMIK which is focussed on reconstruction and economic rehabilitation.
The Council presidency has no knowledge of this issue.
Each country is normally obliged to protect the actions of its undertakings within the international sphere.
Each country has structures to protect its citizens and undertakings internationally and for this reason there are specific mechanisms which we all use every day in our international action.
The European Union is not a country.
That is unless we reach a point at which national governments prove to be incompetent in protecting their own undertakings.
Mr President, an essential element in the reconstruction of post-war society is always that recovery of the local economy should be as rapid as possible, so that it becomes viable once more.
Mr Andersson, to answer your question I should like to start by confirming that a coordinated approach at European level to the information technology and telecommunications sectors is essential for the future development of the European Union.
In particular the Special Meeting invited the Council and Commission to prepare an action plan on e-Europe, which will be presented, to the European Council in June.
The idea of launching an agency devoted to information technology was presented at the Lisbon European Council in the document provided by the Swedish Government.
This idea was not followed up but it responds to our concerns and will definitely be considered and developed in the future.
You rightly make the point that on many occasions specifying these measures may create and worsen inequalities.
In the meantime, the governments have decided that the creation of a new structure and bureaucratic mechanism with high costs is not necessary.
They in fact consider that the structures which currently exist for monitoring this process are sufficient for this purpose.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as an Austrian I am extremely proud of the fact that the Council Presidency has focussed on development in the IT sector.
This process has this national dimension of a commitment on objectives and it is therefore obvious that there are no financial resources for this other than those available in the budget of each country.
In the other dimension, in which recourse to the European Investment Bank is possible, there is a set of actions within the competence of the EU itself, which not only complements previous actions but also ensures greater coherence between the EU' s programmes and actions in this area.
The Commission has been extremely active in this field and the e-Europe programme presented by the Commission and whose action plan will be approved at the Feira European Council in June provides new guidelines for this area and a new reorientation of Community policies on this issue.
As the author is not present, Question No 8 lapses.
We all know the efforts made by the international community in this area and we remember the conclusions of the Beijing Declaration of 1995 on this issue.
Greater involvement is needed in political actions, in the training process and in the administrative process in general.
However, it is the responsibility of each national government to carry out the necessary reforms of its own system of representation in order to guarantee adequate participation by women.
These issues are now being regulated at European level and recommendations are being made as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Helsinki and Cologne Summits specifically gave the Portuguese Presidency the job of strengthening this new protection policy.
The European Union must be progressive.
Women must clearly be involved in political decisions - also decisions with regard to peace - and I ask the Portuguese Presidency to make some reference in this respect.
Bearing in mind these limits, it will be rather difficult, when we set out to assess the new common foreign and security policy structures in terms of defence, to say to the Military Committee or the Military Staff that half of their soldiers should be female.
This is because it is up to the Member States whether or not they have female generals or brigadiers.
Question No 10 by (H-0276/00): Subject: Participation of research partners from the developing countries in environmental research programmes funded by the EU The key to the development of the developing countries is their ability to participate in development work themselves both as definers of problems and as seekers for solutions.
The general objectives of this international scientific cooperation are also set out in this Framework Programme and include support for the development of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership and a contribution to the economic, social and scientific development of developing countries.
In December 1998, the Council also adopted rules on participation by undertakings, research centres and universities and on disseminating research results in order to implement the Fifth Framework Programme.
Article 6 of the Framework Programme authorises the participation by entities of third countries in specific research and technological development activities under the horizontal programme on the international role of Community research.
In January last year, the Council adopted the specific programmes for the Fifth Framework Programme which set out the objectives and activities for the various categories of third countries.
With regard to Mediterranean non-Community countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 55 million was established for research and development activities such as integrated coastal management in the Mediterranean, including environmental aspects, water management, natural resource management, conservation and restoration of the cultural heritage, socio-economic modernisation and so on.
With regard to developing countries, an indicative allocation of EUR 210 million was made available for specific activities such as those involving the adoption of innovations, the promotion of a sustainable relationship between population pressure, food safety and the use and management of ecosystems, the improvement of productivity and the prevention of damage to natural resources.
In addition, a grant system was created under a specific programme which allows graduates and doctoral students from developing countries and Mediterranean non-Community countries to work on European projects.
Mr President-in-Office, I thank you for this reply.
As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses.
Question No 12 by (H-0277/00): Subject: Common defence policy at the IGC There is a 'shortlist' of proposals for the IGC, according to which the Conference will confine itself largely to 'institutional' issues.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Helsinki European Council authorised the Portuguese presidency to establish the EU' s interim security and defence structures as from 1 March of this year.
It is still not clear at this stage of our debate within the European Union whether or not amendments to the Treaty will be necessary.
The Portuguese Presidency will present a report to the Feira European Council in June giving an assessment of the state of progress and an opinion on whether or not these issues should be included within the IGC.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, European defence policy is at present being drafted, and different countries are involved in the task.
There are Member States in NATO and there are countries which are not in NATO.
We hope to ensure that all the various cultures which exist within the Union are compatible.
I would thank the Council.
The crisis management and humanitarian actions specified in the Petersberg tasks to which the Helsinki European Council referred are actions which may be carried out by the European Union.
Question No 13 by (H-0283/00): Subject: Violation of the right to freedom of expression The Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, presided over by a single magistrate, recently banned from circulation a book by the author Mimis Androulakis, describing it as irreverent.
I should like to explain that, under Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union respects a set of basic principles by reference to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The underlying aim of this article is to establish a kind of political supervision over the actions of Member States and to ensure that democratic principles and values are respected.
However, Article 6 cannot be invoked for the purpose of any type of interference in the administration of the internal affairs of Member States, particularly at judicial level.
The Union has no competence to intercede in the exercise of legal power by the Member States.
Therefore, the Council cannot interfere in the decision-making of the authorities.
The judgement delivered by the Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, which is a judgement of a legal body of a Member State on a specific case, may be subject within the Greek legal system to an appeal to the higher national courts.
Having exhausted this recourse to the Greek courts, there would always be recourse to the Court of Human Rights.
Mr Sjöstedt, the Member States undertake to act within the framework determined by the Treaty.
If we were to intervene in a case like this, we would clearly be transposing to the Community dimension an issue for which there is a whole range of recourse in a country which fully respects human and citizens' rights.
Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 14 to 31 will be replied to in writing.
and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) Address by Mr Klestil, President of the Republic of Austria Mr President, you expressed the wish to speak today at our Parliament' s formal sitting.
I took part in the opening at the invitation of the board, and I said in my speech that I fully understood why people should fear a resurgence of racism, intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism - not just in Austria but also in other countries and regions of Europe.
Therefore, in relation to the size of our country, we have offered more refugees sanctuary than any other Member State of the European Union. (Applause) Think of the waves of refugees that came from the East in 1945, from Hungary in 1956, from Czechoslovakia in 1968 and those that have come from former Yugoslavia over the past decade.
In addition, Austria has helped Jewish emigrants from the former Soviet Union to travel to Israel and other countries or to stay with us.
There have certainly been many shortcomings as far as our more recent history is concerned, and we are more conscious of them these days.
It is these very people - and this never ceases to move me - who have often continued to nurture a deep love for what used to be their native land, despite their terrible fate.
There is still a great deal of work to be done on the reappraisal of our past.
I believe that it is in the interests of all Member States to commit themselves to obtaining a clear picture of the true situation in Austria, curtailing criticism, endeavouring to make common cause, and helping to speedily resolve, by means of dialogue, what is a difficult situation for all concerned. (Applause) I am also convinced that it is in the interests of the European Parliament to see to it that work within the European institutions proceeds in the proper manner and in accordance with the law, thereby securing Austria' s full and unconditional cooperation... (Applause) ...
particularly in view of the major issues facing us, such as EU enlargement, reform of the institutions and the European security policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, Austria is a stable democracy and a functioning state under the rule of law.
Therefore, working together with the leaders of the two governing parties, I have drafted a declaration which compels the government to uphold European fundamental values and principles of law.
I have declared before this House on two previous occasions, in 1992 and 1998, that in view of its history and its position at the heart of Europe, Austria feels it has a special mission to make a committed contribution to the completion of the European unification and peace process.
There is no doubt but that Austria has a special interest in the enlargement of the European Union.
Only enlargement will afford us the unique opportunity of creating an area of peace, stability and prosperity at the heart of Europe.
We must also consider the position of the small and medium-sized States within the European Union.
All the people of Europe must play their part in this.
The second phase of the internal reform process began with the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference almost two months ago.
Austria welcomes with open arms the European Parliament' s involvement in the labours of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Bearing in mind the terrible conflicts that have plagued our continent over the past few years, largely in the south-east, it is also essential for the countries of Europe to unite over the issue of a common defence.
Before the European Council takes place in Nice, we must create the conditions that will enable the Union to realise its ambitious goal of creating a European capacity for crisis management.
We know that the security of a union is indivisible and we know that the key to the future security of our own country is to work with each other and for each other.
That is what makes this process so unique, but also so vulnerable.
We must make quite clear to those who are already taking the idea of a united Europe for granted, that it is of fundamental importance to the peace and stability of the whole of Europe to press on with the European integration process.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation Austria currently finds itself in is an unpleasant and grave one for my country and, above all, for its people.
However, it is also unpleasant and grave for the other 14 Member States of the European Union.
On a final note, allow me to thank you once again for inviting me to speak here in the European Parliament.
The memory is of a time in history that tore Europe apart because peoples, and above all their leaders, did not have the strength to react while there was still time. (Applause) It is because of that duty to remember that we cannot accept the way that the extreme right is gaining ground. (Applause) Nothing would be more dangerous to a human society than for its collective conscience to weaken, for it to become accustomed to the unacceptable and for it to relativise the intolerable. (Applause) Thank you, Mr President, for your replies a short while ago to our questions, which give us hope that Austria can once again become a full partner in our Union, which it has never ceased to be in legal terms... (Uproar on the far right)...
but what we hope, Mr President, is that it will also become so in our minds and, to tell the truth, in our hearts. (Loud applause.
The debate which we held recently on the bodies for collective investment in transferable securities and the reactions to the report on pension funds, which we will hear shortly, demonstrate the complexity and importance of these issues.
These two issues, the liberalisation of the financial services market and taxation, are dealt with in the action plan which is the subject of my report.
It is therefore appropriate to thank all the groups for their cooperation and confirm once again to the Commission that it can rely on the active cooperation of the European Parliament in the implementation of this plan, and we will not disregard our duties, but exercise them responsibly.
In my judgement, to sum up, it is the following: the liberalisation of the financial sectors and the updating of the regulations on supervision and control in order to achieve a European financial market which is at least as competitive as the United States financial market.
In order to achieve these two objectives, the Commission proposes a truly arguable and risky formula: the speeding up of the legal process, which, in turn, would involve three actions.
Firstly, a reduction in the standards which need to be included in a regulation or directive, that is to say, which require the participation of this Parliament.
Again we agree, but we know that there are difficulties in this approach resulting from the need to reconcile the objective of liberalisation with the objective of protecting investors.
Personally, I would have liked to have seen a list of those national measures which, in accordance with the Directive on financial services, are hindering the operation of the market in each country.
Liberalisation must therefore be implemented in parallel with the increase in measures relating to control and taxation.
Finally, Mr President, my personal conviction is that, if we do not want liberalisation to give rise to distortions in competition and the flight of capital to more beneficial climates inside and outside the Union, the correct operation of the market in financial services will not be possible without a certain degree of approximation of the laws which regulate savings.
In calling for different legal bases to be established for products and product providers that are defined in different ways, the main aim is to achieve legal certainty in Europe and to afford better opportunities for future integration into the internal market.
Using both of these, we can attempt to achieve full European integration.
Let us, as participants in codecision on future directives, use tomorrow' s vote to send the right signal to the Commission, with a view to bringing stability to old-age provisions in Europe and providing future supplementary pensions in the internal market that are in every sense worthy of the name.
Mr President, I am referring, as you have said, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to the Commission communication on the action plan for the implementation of the framework for the financial markets.
The more liberalised an economy is, the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets.
The Commission, in its proposal, on page 18 of the Spanish version, after recognising the competence of Parliament by means of codecision, in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, tells us that we should move towards very flexible procedures by means of comitology.
I believe that we need some very specific legislation and I am sure that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in the drawing up of this legislation.
As the rapporteur said a moment ago, we cannot expect confidence on the part of investors, consumers and, ultimately, the financial markets, if they do not have a specific legal framework in which to operate.
For example, they would like to use funds in their euro account in country A to settle an account in debit in country B.
Existing legislation, however, prohibits or hinders this type of cash management technique.
The Commission appears to be somewhat apathetic in this regard, and seems to be concentrating rather on producing a directive on prudential rules for pension funds, which is easier to achieve but less effective in terms of decision-making in relation to the elimination of barriers to labour mobility and the coordination of taxation systems.
The legal bases are very important, and, clearly, different: in view of the various judgements delivered by the Court of Justice, pension funds could be governed by Article 47 and Article 55, the removal of barriers to labour mobility could be governed by Article 42 and the coordination of national tax systems by Article 94.
However, I would stress the need and the desirability to develop a single package, because this is the only way to achieve an overall framework which tones down the extreme positions contained in certain proposals for amendments.
I refer, in particular, to biometric risks, which are a very important factor but which should be dealt with on the basis of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Indeed, making cover for biometric risks obligatory would be likely to make the system very inflexible.
If 23% of Europe' s population is over 65 years old today, this figure will have reached 40% by 2025, and the proportion of four working people to every retired person will have become two working people to every retired person by 2020.
This demonstrates the pressing need to allow the development of supplementary self-funded high return pension schemes in the European Union to usefully supplement state contributory pension schemes.
As we all know, our Member States are working towards ambitious structural reforms, but it is also up to the European Union to intervene in the area of pensions, particularly supplementary pensions, in order to facilitate the free movement of workers in the context of the single market, to establish a genuine single capital market and also to ensure that equality between men and women is respected.
With this in mind, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been concerned to reconcile the security and efficiency of supplementary pensions for future pensioners as it is true that the guarantee of a high level of security for beneficiaries encourages healthy and desirable competition between European pension funds.
This is why our Committee feels that the proposal for a directive on Community prudential regulations applying to pension funds must be tabled and adopted as quickly as possible, bearing in mind our discussion today, with proper guarantees for the external and internal supervision of the funds concerned and for the calculation of their prudential commitment.
Furthermore, in order to encourage the free movement of workers, we felt it essential to quickly improve the transferability and the acquisition of pension rights from supplementary schemes from different European countries.
This directive must in particular establish a framework to remove obstacles to the free choice of a pension fund, to the free movement of people, to the free provision of services and to charging double taxes.
We recommend a solution based on the principle that contributions should be tax-deductible, and that supplementary invested income should be taxed in accordance with the income tax law in force in the country of residence.
On the controversial issue of whether supplementary pension schemes should cover biometric risks, I wish to state that from the point of view of taxation, pension funds that do not cover these risks will not be discriminated against in relation to those that do.
That covers the general framework.
I am grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for having included all the relevant conclusions of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities in the motion for a resolution.
With regard to the action plan which seeks to deepen the internal financial services market, I would like to issue a warning about certain strategists who are attempting to hold the liberalisation of the financial services sector hostage, because the work that has been undertaken on the taxation of savings has not made the progress they would have wanted.
As matters currently stand, we should remember that a single market for capital and financial services can function perfectly well without tax harmonisation.
Faced with proposals that confuse ambition and reality, I wish to emphasise that establishing a European Committee for stock exchange operations is certainly not the number one priority and, as I have no speaking time left, Mr President, I will give an explanation of vote tomorrow to say the rest of what I still wanted to say, because as draftsperson of the Committee' s opinion and as a speaker on the second report, it is really impossible to say everything in two minutes.
Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, Mr Kuckelkorn, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the Commission for the sterling work they have done.
It is essential that we do not define the nature and scope of the risk coverage in a restrictive way.
Instead, we should be open-minded and look at the issue from a wider perspective and encourage a framework which is based on liberal markets and vigorous competition between different types of pension schemes.
My firm opinion is that all the different pension schemes should be covered by the same directive in order not to protect certain types of schemes from competition.
Consumers and employers must have the right to choose the most suitable form of pension scheme and, therefore, schemes covering biometric risks should be treated under the same directive as schemes not covering these risks.
Mr Kuckelkorn, no-one in this Parliament is of the opinion that supplementary pensions should not cover the longevity risk, through the purchase of an annuity or by some other tool.
It is not the task of the European Union to define the nature and scope of the risk coverage concerning other biometric risks.
Increased freedom promotes the functioning of the capital market and has a significant impact on the growth of venture capital in Europe.
I am committed to the idea that we, as the European Parliament, should encourage healthy competition and the freedom of choice of the individual.
This must not only mean a single market for supplementary pensions, but the whole package of legislation concerning the financial services.
Mr President, the Socialists support the Commission' s efforts to establish a transparent and fluid internal financial services market.
The action plan aims to make the European market equal to the American market.
It is paradoxical in this context to note that some of the most ardent supporters of financial liberalisation at the same time oppose the euro.
The real introduction of the euro in 2002, however, will result in transparency and competition, which will force the national markets to adapt more quickly than they had anticipated.
The problem is that the legislative bodies, both national and European, are taking a long time to adapt the law to reality.
The Commission could make a useful contribution in the form of proposals simplifying and codifying the 11 or so directives that govern the banking sector, the 8 directives on investment funds, and the 21 directives dealing with the insurance sector.
There is not only a problem of coherence in the various legislations on the different sectors of the financial world, but in particular there is the problem of supervising and protecting the public interest.
John Kenneth Galbraith condemned the mistaken idea that there is any link between money and intelligence.
The lure of profit is such that the financial world tends to create a form of collective euphoria, which often leads to financial crisis.
I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, for the tenacity with which he argues in favour of supplementary pensions and for these to become in effect a second pillar of insurance for old age.
We Liberals do not regard tax harmonisation as a prerequisite for bringing the single market for financial services to fruition, even if a degree of harmonisation may prove to be necessary to avoid harmful competition over taxes.
The euro has stabilised economic development and provided better opportunities to reduce the costs of acquiring capital, something which benefits both companies and private households.
Mr Romano Prodi' s statement today in a Swedish newspaper to the effect that Sweden could stay outside EMU is therefore both surprising from an economic point of view and doubtful in terms of the Treaties.
It is nonetheless important to emphasise that pension cover in Europe is characterised by national diversity and that there is no need to harmonise the various systems in order to create a single market.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the Single European Act was ratified, the financial products market has been developing, despite the warnings of the Greens, without regard to the minimum harmonisation of taxation on income from savings.
Let me formally notify our British colleagues that this attitude is irritating the rest of Europe.
Unfortunately, this point has been changed out of all recognition by the amendments of the right within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The Commission' s proposal and both the reports we are debating today give priority to the needs of the capital market.
The principal aim is for workers, when they move to another Member State, to be able to transfer their supplementary pension schemes and continue to pay into them without forfeiting their pension rights and with a guarantee that their accumulated pension rights will retain their value.
A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safeguarding pensions is an extremely important task facing our age.
But we are quite deliberately proposing an open style of wording, as chosen by Mr Ferri for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in points 7 and 8.
That is why today' s debate has in fact enabled us to embark on the further deepening of the single market, for in the single market and the euro we have, for the first time, the environment we need to get the financial service providers in the EU to operate in a truly efficient manner, and to enable us to take account of the idea of financial legislation and financial supervision.
At the end of the day, when financial conglomerates that are too big to fail come into being, not only does this increase the moral hazard of the institutes concerned, but the economic and financial policies of the States concerned are also faced with new risks.
It is regrettable that there is no direct consideration of consumer protection in the Lisbon Conclusions.
On the other hand, we are also in agreement with the participation of workers and the urgent harmonisation of the tax provisions.
Nevertheless, we have to clarify the basic concept of pensions in a way which includes the supplementary pension schemes which cover biometric risks.
It is necessary to clarify, on the other hand, that the single system applies to every type of worker in the European Union; there are not only workers who work for themselves in the European Union but also many cooperative workers, fortunately.
We therefore understand and support the regulatory and supervisory systems for the protection of the rights of participants, but we must put the emphasis on the areas where systems are still underdeveloped, in aspects such as providing information or implementing new plans.
Finally, I would like to underline our support for the creation of a European pension fund with the participation of the different economic sectors and the pension providers.
Mr President, the ageing of the population and the reduction in the numbers of people of working age, while real enough, have been put forward by the Commission and other Members as a reason to open up the way for pension funds for supplementary pension schemes.
The dynamic of growth and job creation has run its course.
The capitalisation mechanisms mean adapting retirement pensions to the single market and the introduction of the euro.
Moving in this direction entails the risk of a system based on private insurance, which would gradually replace social security.
I cannot, therefore, approve this report which makes the Commission' s approach even worse.
The contributory system guarantees the rights of the employed and provides them with a pension, in the framework of national solidarity between the working population and the retired population, between generations, between men and women, between the public and the private sectors.
The objective should be to obtain new resources and to upgrading the purchasing power of retirement pensions from contributions which could be raised from taxes on financial products at the same level as those which apply to wages.
In the UK, as in the US, Chile and Singapore and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands, the burden on the state and succeeding generations has been significantly eased through the successful provision of supplementary second and third pillar private and occupational pension schemes, involving funds which grow to provide pension benefits following the retirement of the individuals.
I welcome the fact that there is widespread recognition in this House to extend these supplementary schemes throughout Europe, even if there are disagreements over their precise nature and the way that the funds are to be invested.
It is even predicted that if the current trend continues some countries will be facing costs of up to 20% of their GDP in the next ten years for their pension liabilities.
There are, of course, many risks with equity investments, but there are even greater risks to Europe with stagnant economies.
Growing pension funds will dynamise our economies by providing large additional capital funds for investment not only in the EU, but also in developing markets, with greater prospects for future growth and returns on investment for our pensioners.
In the case of defined contribution schemes, which give the investor a direct stake in the overall health of the national economy, there will also be a sense of participation in the country of that individual.
We need a light-touch regulatory framework, with bilateral tax agreements, which will ensure the portability for those EU nationals wishing to work abroad throughout the Union, achieve a genuine single market in financial services and provide maximum choice to the European investor.
These Finance Ministers may then have to pay yet again because they will have to resign their posts, as punishment for their foolish actions.
That is why the debate as presented to us in Amendment No 30, on the freedom of choice of the insured, is a pseudo discussion.
Mr President, this report seeks to harmonise supplementary pensions in Europe.
Indeed, it recommends the development of a truly single pension fund market by referring to the inevitability of resorting to capitalisation.
This report puts forward cynical arguments and seeks to give credence to the idea that only capitalisation would ensure better protection of low incomes.
This is in perfect harmony with past, present and future struggles, and it is in support of them that we shall be voting against a report that reduces this Parliament to the level of a lobby for high finance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all in favour of securing future financing for pensions, having an equitable and stable inter-generation compact, and creating a workable, clearly defined three-pillar model that increases the individual' s range of options and supports the mobility of employees.
We are not in agreement on whether supplementary company pensions supplement the first or the third pillar.
Almost 90% of the professional population in the private sector are in pension schemes which guarantee a wage-related pension.
This also includes small and medium-sized businesses.
It has been shown that it is precisely the compulsory nature of participation in collective pension funds which encourages these excellent results.
As for biometric risks, other speakers have already talked enough about this.
Mr President, we are voting against this report advocating self-funded pension schemes.
This system restricts employees who want to guarantee a retirement pension for themselves that will give them enough to live on, to make their money available to investment funds, trusts, insurance companies or other private financial groups.
If we are to strengthen the second pillar then it must be made equivalent to the first and built up accordingly, that is, it must take account of the biometric risks.
But we should not establish a system today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, supplementary pensions and complementary pensions schemes are of course gaining constantly in importance and in market value on account of democratic development.
Only good quality products will be able, in the context of the second and third pillars, to fulfil a social function for the European social model.
Unfortunately, we are forced to note that this is the case for the majority of Member States.
Needless to say, the objective of making employees more mobile and flexible within a large single European market and the euro zone will inevitably lead to interest in supplementary pension schemes.
This, unfortunately, is at the expense of Member States which already have their house in order.
The supplementary pension scheme is based on collective feeling and solidarity.
The second point is that it is important that we provide decent pensions to enable citizens to move around Europe.
The biometric risks problem means many different things to different people.
In almost all Member States the pension systems comprise three elements: statutory pension schemes, company pension schemes and supplementary private pension schemes.
Discussion is currently ongoing in all Member States as to how we can reform the pensions system.
As has already been said repeatedly, the Kuckelkorn report concerns itself with pensions in the second pillar, i.e.
What this actually means, for example, is that an employee who has a car accident at the age of 35 and becomes an invalid, receives not only the capital he has paid in up to that point but also a proper company pension, because he is the same position as if he had worked until he was 60 years old.
We must ensure that the concept of a pension is not just understood to mean a form of savings scheme, for a capital investment... (The President cut the speaker off.) Mr President, we are facing a difficult issue, as evidenced by the large number of speakers.
I believe that the systems we should pursue in Europe should be based on two principles.
Firstly, risks tied in with the second and third pillars should be sufficiently covered, because far too little has been said about this.
Mr President, the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs makes it clear that the pay-as-you-go based, statutory pensions schemes in the Member States need to be supplemented by capital-backed company or other supplementary pensions schemes.
I am in favour of compromising with "cooperation" rather than introducing the frequently obstructive concept of "codetermination" .
The Commission welcomes the attention which the report pays to the need for capital markets to function to optimum effect.
We also have a few specific proposals in this respect.
Firstly, we would propose the provision of better information on financial products for citizens.
Thirdly, we would propose better harmonisation for the present national consumer protection rules.
The report will be made available shortly.
Mr President, most speakers have expressed their thoughts on the issue of pensions and I would like to say the following on this matter.
In its communication on pensions, the Commission has included proposals on three fronts.
However, this does not detract from the fact that investment and management rules can also serve the interests of people other than pension scheme members.
This coordination is a precondition for cross-border labour mobility.
More than anything, and this is also underlined in the draft report - rightly so - we should facilitate the transferability of rights from one Member State to another, and this is also very much in the interests of employee mobility, of course.
This is also echoed in the motion for a resolution.
Agreement on this approach would solve the problems of either double taxation or no taxation, which is what citizens and Member States are struggling with at the moment.
However, I would like to point out that this issue, as is known, only and exclusively concerns the competences of the Member States and, as such, falls outside the scope of the European Commission.
These standards will differ in certain aspects according to the risks actually covered by the institutions.
I think that the European Union would not do itself any favours if the subject of the directive were to be limited to biometric risks and I can honestly see no reason why other forms of pension schemes could not be included in the same directive, as I pointed out a moment ago.
In other words, there is still a large degree of freedom for the Member States to arrange the pension systems within their own country as they see fit.
This freedom remains.
Accordingly, we need to set up this legal framework within the European Union which enables businesses and future pensioners to choose the products on offer within a transparent market by institutions which are adequately supervised.
In the final analysis, many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, but since she has reminded me of this question, which, as I have already said, I would have addressed at a later stage, let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market.
The new strategy for the internal market comprises one hundred or so measures, many of which will be beneficial to small and medium-sized businesses.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Allow me to make two observations: the Committee on Legal Affairs has not accepted all the suggestions of the committee asked for an opinion.
We were in complete agreement with most of them and they seemed to us to be very interesting, but we consider that this resolution was not the right place for them and that, by incorporating them, its message would be less clearly expressed.
That has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this House.
What was that message?
The internal market appears to have become very small in this new globalised economy.
This document on the strategy for the internal market expresses this very clearly.
We need to put the emphasis on the principles of the internal market: the principle of proportionality, the principle of mutual recognition, the principle of control of origin.
We need to strengthen our infringement procedure, we need to consolidate it, make it more transparent and more accessible.
The second message of this resolution is that we need to make the present, rather disorganised laws, which the citizens see as a burden, into a genuine legislation, a coherent and clear framework of rules and regulations, without any overlapping or contradictions.
These contradictions are seen by the citizen and by industry as burdens, as a lack of clarity in the message regarding the direction we are taking.
Lastly, the third message is a change in the business culture in Europe.
To this end we will have to change certain laws, such as for example the European laws on insolvency in general, on the suspension of payments and bankruptcy.
Mr President, once again the European Parliament must express its opinion on the Commission communication on the construction of the internal market, in this case, a new version of it.
A proportion of its content affects the competences of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
This new version does contain specific measures and proposals.
Let us then analyse the content of these proposals, albeit in general terms.
We notice a lack of such political courage in this document since the chapter on tax simply reproduces previous Commission commitments, and even leaves aside some of the European Parliament' s proposals.
Secondly, in relation to the rules on competition, the Communication opts for deepening the process of reform underway, and this deserves our support.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is natural that I should speak about the problems which the strategy for developing the internal market may pose from a social point of view.
We are starting with a European social model - which is a national model - and we are transforming the economic structure of that society.
We have had examples such as the case of Venezuela where a strictly private system of public transport led to a profound social and political crisis in that country.
Liberalisation presents other difficulties.
For example, when public services and public companies are privatised and those public companies come to be controlled by a private sector which in reality replaces the state monopoly with a private monopoly, liberalisation may not come about effectively at all.
Liberalisation by means of privatising public companies may end up consolidating dominant positions and private monopolies which in my opinion may offer fewer benefits than a monopoly conceived in the public interest.
Another aspect - which we referred to in the recent debate on the Kuckelkorn report - is the need to coordinate social protection.
Social protection in a single internal market cannot simply be left to subsidiarity.
The lack of action is related to the original conception of this policy.
The current Council Regulation No 3760/92 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture, provides for derogations in respect of the internal market, notably in Articles 6 and 7, which allow derogations from the principle of freedom of access to fishing grounds, so that Member States have the right of exclusive exploitation of their fisheries resources within a 12-mile coastal band, as well as a series of preferential fishing rights, through application of the 'relative stability' principle, which distributes national fishing quotas.
These restrictions on the principle of freedom of action, which were originally intended to be temporary restrictions, have been extended and will be in force until 1 January 2003 as a mechanism to allow certain Member States' fishing industries to adapt to the rules of free competition in an increasingly open and globalised market.
Therefore, the principles and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties should also be applied to fisheries, in other words, the framework of the common fisheries policy should be brought into line with the general legal framework of Community legislation.
Our committee and, indeed, our Group has been emphasising, since this new Parliament started last year, the need to encourage the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises across the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has to be said that the European Commission' s current strategy for bringing about the actual realisation and improvement of the internal market has already been the subject of debate in this House on quite a number of occasions.
The introduction of the euro has already brought all the shortcomings of the internal market into sharper relief and it will accentuate them even more clearly in the future.
It is important to get the proposed measures underway quickly.
The promised dialogue between the Commission on the one hand and business and citizens on the other is to be welcomed because the relationship between the Commission, the European Parliament and society should, after all, be interactive.
The e-Europe initiative praises the use and expertise of Internet and multimedia.
In order to build a genuine internal market, we should, more than anything, concentrate on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized businesses.
Legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language.
Mr President, I would like to speak on a point of order.
In the Spanish version which I have there is no problem.
The Spanish text simply says "remove the barriers imposed on entrepreneurs capitalising on company value through the issue of share options on the stock exchange" .
Mr President, many thanks for giving me the floor regarding an issue which is very dear to the Commission as a whole and myself, in particular, namely the new strategy for the internal market.
It would be an example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, if Parliament or the Commission were to say that they refuse to make further attempts to integrate the financial services if no progress were made in terms of the taxation package.
The Commission is trying to flesh this out and this also means that those state monopolies need to allow for more competition in the fields I mentioned a moment ago.
In Europe it takes far longer, even as long as five months, a ratio of 1 in 30.
Could I once again express my appreciation to the Members of Parliament and the rapporteur, in particular, for the important vote of confidence which we received from Parliament regarding the new strategy for the internal market?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It was not only these concerns that were highlighted by the various amendments to the original text proposed by honourable Members of this House, but also those regarding a real policy in this area which, without infringing the subsidiarity principle, would ensure the quality and the effectiveness of the campaign to encourage language learning, as well as the diversity of target-groups, paying particular attention to the less favoured sectors of society.
For these reasons, and with my thanks for all the cooperation given to me by fellow Members, by the Portuguese Presidency and by the Commission, I am honoured to propose that we vote in favour of the joint proposal for a decision on the European Year of Languages, in the version contained in the compromise text, the main features of which I have just outlined.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rarely has there been so much insight and common sense in evidence on all sides of this House, as is proving to be the case during this debate today.
As the Socrates rapporteur, I am very much in favour of placing special emphasis on the importance of learning the language spoken by one' s European neighbours, and of launching pilot projects on this very issue, in the course of the Year of Languages.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Year of Languages 2000 is intended to achieve several goals, one being to promote awareness of the fact that linguistic diversity within the European Union is part of our cultural heritage.
The exchange of information, the collation and processing of experiences, as well as the development of new, modern methods of improving access to languages and making it more efficient, is also one of this project' s key areas of concern.
The main aim of this Year of Languages is, as has already been said, to urge the people of Europe to learn several languages, both for their own benefit as the basis for improved understanding and integration within the European Union.
The report has been prepared and agreement reached on more than 100 proposed amendments within a very short space of time.
Two weeks ago, we reached agreement with the representatives of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, but I am sorry to say that this was called into question on Monday of this week.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour, and we expect the Council to give its representatives a mandate for negotiations, or to confirm to us that further talks will be necessary.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support initiatives which may create greater awareness of the value of linguistic diversity in the European Union.
It is important that the EU' s citizens should be encouraged to learn foreign languages early on in school and also throughout their lives.
Finally, in the programme for the European Year of Languages, consideration is also given to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, something which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party consider to be crucial to all EU programmes.
I come from a bilingual country myself and I have met some people in that country who never learn the other language, despite the fact that they attend language classes, sometimes for twelve years, and are still unable to speak another language.
I therefore hope that in the course of this year of European languages, research will be carried out into the best language teaching methods and, more than anything, how Europeans can be encouraged to learn the language of the other Europeans using a modern and appealing method.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the diversity of languages is a source of cultural wealth.
That is why we must convince parents, teachers and politicians that language learning must begin at primary school level, or even at pre-school level.
We must do more than simply argue in favour of the diversity of languages and call for differences to be respected.
This leads on to the debate on the official languages of the Community and the recognised languages, be they national or regional, of all of today' s countries and those of tomorrow, particularly in the context of enlargement, which, as we all know, is a cause for concern for us in terms of languages.
Europeans must not neglect any language, nor must they forget the languages of the immigrants present in considerable numbers in our countries, or sign language which is the minority language par excellence.
I feel that a successful awareness campaign must, of course, present languages as subjects to be studied and as a mechanism for exchang but it must also remind people that languages are also a source of fun and a pleasure.
I would also add our own mother tongue to the equation.
The English sage, Francis Bacon, said that knowledge is power, so knowledge of the basic languages from which our modern European languages derive improves our general knowledge and reinforces European civilisation, which, besides its humanitarian value, is also a weapon for our survival and prosperity as Europeans in a globalised economy.
It is the most important bond for a nation.
At the same time it is also the right of each citizen in each Member State.
Mr President, in addition to congratulating the rapporteur, I would like to highlight in this debate that the idea for this celebration originates from the Council of Europe, an institution with a particular sensitivity towards the cultural and social aspects of the old continent, which, with its initiative of increasing the knowledge and use of more languages by Europeans, hopes to promote understanding and tolerance and bring citizens closer together.
In Europe, many other languages are spoken, some of them thousands of years old such as Euskera in the Basque Country or Gaelic, whose origins have been lost in the mists of time, and others such as Catalan, Galician and Alsatian, which is spoken right here in Strasbourg.
Furthermore, the learning of languages leads to an awareness of our cultural diversity and contributes to the eradication of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, which forms part of our Community objectives.
I would also ask, in this era when emotions often take precedence over good sense, that we do not support projects which are aimed at exclusion and the use of language to support positions which often seek to cause divisions between people, when the objective of this programme is to unite people.
I am referring, for example, to Ladino and Yiddish.
Of the 150 languages which are spoken in Europe, we should make a list of those which are only transmitted from mothers to their children, which are only spoken in a domestic setting and which, currently, with the invasion of the media and with the official use of languages in schools, will have very few years to live.
Mr President, I should like to address my remarks on languages to my fellow Members, of course, but also to our interpreters, who enable this Parliament to function, to the rapporteur, of course, not for his work as rapporteur but because he is also a poet in this Parliament and, moreover, as I have discovered, one who speaks my mother tongue perfectly.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a sound report, that much I can say.
Languages reflect the diversity of the European Union.
In some parts of our region, for example, children learn the languages of our neighbours as early as the kindergarten stage through play.
It is to some extent a laboratory which could serve as a basis for others who would like to do what we all wish to do during this European Year of Languages, which is to promote the study of one' s mother tongue and of two additional languages.
On the other hand, we are at a crucial stage, as there is the prospect of achieving agreement at first reading between the Parliament and the Council.
This leads me to the second great aim of the European Year of Languages: we must encourage the public to learn languages and to do so throughout their lives, starting at a very early age, in nursery school.
The European Year of Languages is also a framework, which will enable information to be disseminated on how to learn languages.
Methods have moved on from the traditional ones and much work has been done in this area.
The year will be organised in close cooperation with the Council of Europe, which is extremely significant.
Many fruitful meetings have already taken place and the ongoing exchange of information between our respective departments is vital to the implementation of this Year of Languages.
It is important to emphasise the fact that the amendments voted for by the European Parliament must be acceptable to the Council if agreement is to be reached at first reading.
You also know, however, how sensitive this issue is for certain Member States.
I think that the definition of target languages as stated in article 1, Amendment No 15, provides sufficient scope, whilst enabling everyone to agree on it.
And I am relying a great deal, believe me, on the debates that will take place during 2001, the European Year of Languages, because these debates will enable us to overcome the problems and fears which still exist with regard to minority languages.
I also hope that at the end of this Year of Languages, their will be no more resistance to languages, because, as has been very clearly stated, there are no small languages, there are only mother tongues, which are all great languages.
I am therefore relying on the debates to help me prepare future activities in this area, and I would also draw your attention to the additional recitals which address this concern: Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4.
The recitals also enable us to take account of other specific concerns, as many of you have pointed out, such as classical languages and cultures, which will not be forgotten during the European Year of Languages.
The Commission' s draft text proposed a limited number of studies with a direct bearing on the organisation of the European Year of Languages.
The Members of the European Parliament have proposed a great many additional studies.
It goes without saying that the field of language learning is in constant development, which is why these studies are necessary.
On the other hand, the Council is not prepared to accept a long list of studies which could not all be carried out under the European Year of Languages.
My feeling is that we all agree that this point should not become a reason for agreement not to be reached at first reading.
Given its awareness of the importance of languages in the process of European integration, the Commission has committed itself to developing these issues when implementing its programme of studies, which will be carried out in the framework of, and in accordance with the procedures of, the various programmes and activities which can be enlisted for this purpose in the spirit of article 8 of the proposed decision.
The promotion of bilingual publishing, mentioned in Amendment No 41, is covered by the Culture 2000 programme, and I shall see to it that projects undertaken in this area are given the priority that they deserve.
Finally, it is true that enlargement of the European Union and the growth in the number of official languages will have certain implications, as Amendment No 36 suggests.
Nevertheless, this issue is beyond the remit of the European Year of Languages and, furthermore, is a matter for all three political institutions.
I am therefore committing myself to doing everything in my power to encourage discussion on this point in the appropriate setting, whist hoping that I can count on the necessary support of the European Parliament.
Lastly, I would like to say a few words about the amendments presented in plenary.
Amendments Nos 43 and 12 have the same content, but the wording of Amendment No 43 is better.
Nevertheless, we know that the Council will not accept Amendments Nos 47, 48, 49, 50 and 51, which relate in particular to regional and minority languages, since we have already discussed this in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
As these amendments would jeopardise the chances of agreement being reached at first reading, I cannot accept them.
To sum up, Mr President, it is important that we quickly reach agreement so that we can launch the European Year of Languages.
I am sure that they will be incorporated into the text, as far as possible, and I shall also take them into consideration in other programmes and activities where we have the opportunity to encourage the promotion and learning of languages, not only in 2001, but well beyond that, because the year 2001 will be only the starting point in the campaign we are fighting for all mother tongues to be recognised at European level.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Although some prayers remained unanswered, the parliamentary delegation could be satisfied with EUR 520 million for the seven year term, with a review clause on the accession of the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
The negotiations for the Youth programme have dragged on for around one and three quarter years.
We have drastically amended the original proposal by the Commission, which envisaged combining the existing programmes "Youth for Europe" and the European Voluntary Service in one five year programme.
We wanted to simplify administrative structures and do more to develop disadvantaged young people.
The Commission adopted a raft of amendments put forward by Parliament, however the Council was unable to reach agreement on a common position concerning EUR 350 million for a five-year programme.
At second reading, the European Parliament concentrated on 13 Amendments, focusing largely on the Budget, on a seven-year term following the example of Socrates and Leonardo, and on a flexible age limit and social protection in matters of comitology.
At the second meeting of the conciliation committee we were able, following difficult negotiations, to reach agreement on all issues.
But, as rapporteur, I welcome the fact that the Youth programme is enabling us to send out a signal that the programme really is open to all young people.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in one month' s time, on the 9 May 2000, Parliament will be celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Robert Schumann' s declaration.
The new programme closes the gap, as it were, between the youth and educational programmes that are already running.
Parliament, as well as the Commission and the Council, saw that there was a need for this programme, even if, as the rapporteur has just said, considerable hurdles had to be overcome in relation to the financial framework.
The new programme is more comprehensible and more citizen-friendly.
But the fact that we are still here so early in the morning is a tribute to the rapporteur' s work on this programme and, indeed, that of the Commissioner and the Portuguese presidency - which has shown itself to be committed to youth, to the voluntary service and to education in its broadest sense.
We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well.
We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report.
Through increased communication between young people in Europe, the programme will indirectly help combat xenophobia and increase respect for human rights.
Finally, the Community' s action programme for youth also gives consideration to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, something which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believe to be of crucial importance to all EU programmes.
It is a very good report.
Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored.
The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries.
The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I bid you good morning!
Voluntary activities in the environmental and cultural spheres help people to learn what Europe is really all about and also to learn other languages.
This new programme has enabled us to consolidate and improve on previous youth activities.
We welcome the exchange programme because it reinforces mutual trust between the young people of different countries and encourages mutual tolerance, and a willingness to cooperate and show solidarity.
What goes on in the heads of young people of today has a special resonance for the future development and functioning of the European Union and European consciousness.
I am emphasising these two aspects because, as Mrs Pack has already said, the sanctions against Austria are having most impact on cultural organisations, and the educational and scientific spheres, as well as on scientific cooperation.
The Youth programme is crucial to the European Union, as you have all already said, because it is a unique programme, in which all young people, without distinction, can participate.
In the Youth programme and in the way it is implemented, there will be no sanctions against anyone, and that includes young Austrians, who will not be discriminated against.
This programme will encourage and consolidate the continuation and development of innovative actions at Community level and will help to improve the quality of the action undertaken on behalf of young people.
It therefore represents a useful instrument in assisting a policy of cooperation and will contribute to the process of European integration.
In addition to ensuring that the programme is effectively implemented, I wish to make a commitment before this House that I will encourage a process of structured and regular cooperation with Member States, in order to work towards drawing up action plans that are up to the task of the challenges, and without which the programme would be less effective.
I would now like to clarify the role of this White Paper and the role of political catalyst that youth policy must play in the future.
I hope to prepare the White Paper on the basis of broad consultation with the different parties concerned and when I say the parties involved I mean above all young people.
That is why, at the Youth Council on 23 November last year, I proposed to the Member States' Ministers for Youth that they hold national meetings of young people during the first half of 2000.
This proposal was very warmly received by all the Member States and these meetings are being organised at the moment.
Most Member States have already set dates for them and most of them have also assured me that these meetings will be open, with the participation of all possible parties including, of course, Members of the European Parliament.
These meetings must allow young people to play an active role and to assert their aspirations, their expectations and their opinions, but also their recommendations for political action in the areas that affect them.
The various national meetings will culminate in a huge European meeting which will be held at the beginning of October, under the French Presidency.
We will also rely on the various studies on young people, which will be financed under the Youth programme, and the study, already underway, on the status of young people and the situation of youth policy in Europe.
Lastly, I would like to include the European Parliament in this exercise.
To conclude, I would like to emphasise the fact that the consultation process, particularly with regard to young people, will not be a one-off exercise, because the publication of the White Paper will constitute the second stage of this dialogue with the parties involved, and this is a dialogue that I would like to see established on a more permanent basis.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
