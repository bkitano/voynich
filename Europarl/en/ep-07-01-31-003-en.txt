I am sure that you have all heard about the terrible murder, on 19 January, of the Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink, who had, over recent years, frequently drawn attention to himself with his calls for engagement with the history of the Armenians under Ottoman rule, attracting the hostility of many nationalists and being repeatedly prosecuted by the Turkish justice system on account of what he wrote and said.
The alleged murderer - who is only 17 years of age - is evidently motivated by, among other things, nationalist sentiments and complete contempt for the opinions of others.
