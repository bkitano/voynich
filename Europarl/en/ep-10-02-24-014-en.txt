Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010) (debate) The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010).
Mr President, the European Union is preparing, in Geneva, in Brussels and in the capitals of third countries, for the first session of this year of the Human Rights Council.
The EU would also actively participate in a panel on the rights of persons with disabilities.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is going to adopt a resolution on the upcoming session of the Human Rights Council.
The Human Rights Council would then risk becoming as defunct and inefficient as its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights.
That is why I am very pleased that, at the organisational meeting in Geneva on 18 February, both the European Union and the United States spoke in favour of the joint study on secret detention being presented to the Human Rights Council this time.
