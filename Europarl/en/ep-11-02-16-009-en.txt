I would like to give particular thanks to the Chairs of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Petitions (PETI), Carlo Casini and Erminia Mazzoni.
The four rapporteurs, Alain Lamassoure, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis and Gerald HÃ¤fner - I hope you are present and we can go through the procedure together - as well as the many other Members involved as shadow rapporteurs.
