Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (debate) - The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the negotiations taking place in May 2009 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on the conditions for the entry into force of the Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0224/2009).
In Bangladesh, for example, not one of the 36 dismantling sites complies with minimum environmental and safety standards.
In May of this year, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is holding a global conference in Hong Kong, the aim of which is to conclude a global agreement on the recycling of ships for scrapping.
I would especially like to thank Mr Blokland.
The first is paragraph 3 - to which Mr Blokland himself has also already referred - which states that ships should be considered in their entirety as hazardous waste and should therefore fall within the scope of the Basel Convention.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 March 2009.
