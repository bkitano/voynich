Draft general budget of the European Union - Financial year 2008 (vote) - Before the vote Mr President, before the beginning of the vote, I want to make the following statement.
After the vote, the Committee on Budgets issued a request to retable the following four amendments: Amendment 990: + EUR 1.53m on line 16 03 04, commitment appropriations only; Amendment 24: on line 15 05 55, commitment appropriations only, reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938; Amendment 989: + EUR 1 million on line 16 03 02, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations; Amendment 1043: + EUR 1 million on line 15 06 06, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations, plus additional remarks from Amendment 25, with the figure EUR 1 million instead of EUR 1.5 million.
These technical changes and specifications were dealt with and approved at the meeting of Committee on Budgets of 11 October 2007.
Finally, the remarks adopted in Amendment 634 do not appear in Amendments 1018 on budget line 15 02 02 05; 934 on budget line 09 06 01; 938 on budget line 15 05 55, and 940 on budget line 17 02 02.
On top of that, we held a discussion at the coordinators' meeting yesterday and, according to their decisions, I recommend rejecting Amendment 752 and voting in favour of Amendment 610 on line 16 02 02 (multimedia actions), but taking the reserve from Amendment 752, and rejecting Amendment 1044 and voting in favour of Amendment 32 on line 16 02 03. - After the vote on Amendment 878 (FI) Mr President, regarding Amendment 878, it has to do with the pilot projects and has been accepted.
I would therefore ask that we vote first on Amendment 610, and then on the reserve from Amendment 752. - Before the vote on Amendment 990 rapporteur. - Mr President, I think this is covered by my earlier statement. - After the vote on block 6 Mr President, in Amendment 951, the German text is the correct one.
Some of the other languages contain mistakes, so please follow the German text. - Before the vote on block 8 rapporteur. - Mr President, before starting to vote on the budgetary amendments, I would like to inform you of a limited number of technical adjustments that need to be made.
Concerning Chapter 101, Plenary should vote only on the final amount in Amendment 1004, which is EUR 5 million.
Concerning Sections VI and VII: in Amendment 1013, the second and third paragraphs of the justification to the amendment should replace the respective paragraphs in the justification in Amendment 1001, and the second paragraph in Amendments 986, 1007 and 999.
