Accession of Bulgaria (vote) - Before the vote on amendment 2: Mr President, with regard to amendment 2 by my group, I should like to tell you that the Van Orden report brings this Parliament away from the legal basis of the accession protocol. (DE) We have stipulated in the accession protocol that the Kosloduj nuclear power station must be shut down.
Thank you, Mrs Harms.
