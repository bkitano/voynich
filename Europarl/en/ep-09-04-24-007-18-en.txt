Due to the absence of many MEPs - more than 400 are absent - we have been unable to adopt the package of amendments, which requires a qualified majority of 393 votes at second reading.
I should therefore like to ask the Bureau and Parliament's administration to look into how we can salvage the situation at this point before Parliament goes into recess after 7 May, so that we can discuss and restore this situation during the next part-session.
