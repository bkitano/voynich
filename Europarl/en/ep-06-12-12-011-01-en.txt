The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will complete the fifth enlargement of the European Union.
Both Meglena Kuneva and Leonard Orban were deeply involved in the negotiations for their respective countries' membership.
Let me offer a word of advice to President Barroso as he chews on how to use the talents of his two latest recruits: there are not enough jobs for 27 Commissioners.
My colleagues and I from the UK Independence Party were vilified in 2004 because we opposed the accession, but we did so for several reasons, not least that we are totally opposed to the European Union's empire-building because it is a thoroughly undemocratic organisation that undermines self-government.
It will not be many years before Bulgaria and Romania discover what a mistake they have made in subjecting themselves to the will of an intolerant European Commission.
Freedom is indivisible.
