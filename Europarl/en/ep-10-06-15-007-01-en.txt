Election of a Vice-President of the European Parliament (vote) We now come to the election of a Vice-President of the European Parliament pursuant to Rules 13, 15 and 18 of our Rules of Procedure.
On my screen, I have the name Tőkés.
The clear answer is that in this vote, we are reacting only to votes in favour.
I would like to congratulate our fellow Member, Mr Tőkés, on obtaining a result which qualifies him to be Vice-President of Parliament, and I wish him success in performing his duties.
