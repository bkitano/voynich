on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the UEN Group I would like to thank Mrs Sudre for taking up this subject.
The territorial cohesion referred to in the Treaty of Lisbon - though not intended in a literal, geographical sense - must also have a dimension that includes the Union's most distant regions.
Perhaps Mrs HÃ¼bner can say whether the Commission is completely ready for these three islands with a total population of 19 000 to be accepted by us as a whole. (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, besides congratulating our colleague Mrs Sudre on her excellent report, I would like to make three points on the European Union's future strategy for the outermost regions.
Mme Sudre, I see your report as helping to build a bridge between the present and future strategies for the outermost regions and that is a very important role of this report.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 20 May 2008.
