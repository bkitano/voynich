Data protection and consumers' rights (debate) The next item is the Commission statement on data protection and consumers' rights.
In this particular case, which is the merger of Google and Double Click, the case is still being analysed by the Commission in order to decide whether the envisaged merger is in line with Regulation 139/2004/EC (the 'Merger Regulation').
Just now I mentioned the case of Facebook, where consumers used their muscle to make Facebook more careful about privacy.
The structure of the merger may endanger that privacy, yet the national authorities do not have the capacity to know how those data are being manipulated, and neither will consumers know where their data are going or how they are being used by third parties. . - (SV) Mr President, the consumer is defenceless on the Internet.
As you know, and as I have just pointed out in my introduction, the existing rules are applied with reference to the territory in which a particular provider is established, but this geographical limit is not really in keeping with the Internet.
The security of electronic networks and computerised systems along with technologies for enhancing personal data protection are the main concern of the Strategy for a Safe Information Society, adopted by the Commission in 2006.
