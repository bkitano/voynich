Financial services policy (2005-2010) - White Paper (vote) - Report: van den Burg - Before the vote on paragraph 26 rapporteur. - On this paragraph, I propose withdrawing the oral amendments but asking the PPE-DE Group if they can agree that both amendment 5 from their side and amendment 17 from the ALDE Group are compatible and that we can vote on both of them.
