on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we are truly delighted that this important debate is taking place so promptly after a question on patients' rights was tabled by several ALDE Group members, which was in fact initiated by Dr Parvanova, a Bulgarian Observer colleague.
I would like to point out that members of the public may submit comments on this communication up until 31 January 2007.
Commissioner, you have instituted a public consultation process on the issues surrounding patient mobility.
