Rule 149 states that we can establish whether a quorum is present.
The President responds to such a request by establishing whether or not the quorum exists.
I hear that you have received a request from 40 Members of this House for you to establish this afternoon whether the quorum is present or not.
Try as we might, we are unlikely to reach 200 this afternoon unless everybody turns up.
That is what the Rules of Procedure say. (DE) Mr President, Mr Leinen, I am a veteran of these topical and urgent debates.
The debate can take place.
Paragraph 4 is quite clear.
Having said that, Mr Leinen was right to draw our attention to the fact that the way in which paragraph 4 is written could cause confusion.
This is why I think that this is a very good time - and it is not up to me to decide this, but to the competent bodies - for the Committee that you chair, Jo, to clarify very quickly whether or not paragraph 3 states that the Members have to be present when they submit their quorum request, and whether or not the Members have to be present when the count is done, at the start of the count.
