Mr President, before going into the details of the report, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bourzai and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their very good work carried out on this fairly sensitive issue, namely the marketing of bovine meat at an age lower than 12 months.
I am talking about Amendments 8 and 12, which were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Amendment 8 suggests that designations and IGPs (protected geographical indications) registered after the publication of this regulation could be exempted from it, and this is not consistent with the legislation as a whole.
Amendment 12 calls into question the proposal for a regulation based on the criterion of age.
It is particularly important that the term 'veal' and other terms defined in the Commission proposal should not be used in labelling meat from animals aged over 12 months.
Therefore, to treat as equal and call 'veal' meat from an animal up to the age of six or eight months that has been fed on milk and meat from an animal aged 14 to 16 months that eats, grazes and ruminates, allows neither the consumer nor the producer to determine what he is actually eating.
Similarly, Amendments 1 and 9, regarding the extension of the field of application to cover cooked products, are not indispensable.
Finally, Amendments 8 and 21 would not clarify the approval procedure for PDOs and PGIs and would also overly complicate the amendment procedure of the different annexes in the proposal.
With regard to Amendment 12, aimed at marketing the use of sale descriptions established for meat of the second category of these animals -those between 8 and 12 months - I am prepared to try to find a solution with the ministers on the usefulness of this option.
