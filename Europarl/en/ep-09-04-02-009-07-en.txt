Educating the children of migrants ( - Before the vote: (DE) Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to the effect that, in points 5, 8 and 16, the word 'legal' should be deleted, as it gives the impression that children who are not registered, in other words involved in a current asylum procedure, could be excluded from the education programmes.
I heard paragraphs 5 and 16; paragraph 8 also states that only the children of 'legal' migrants would receive education.
