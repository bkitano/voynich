Explanations of vote Oral explanations of vote (PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the European Strategy for the Danube Region, because I think the European Union needs such regional strategies.
We are isolating Taiwan; we have agreed in principle to sell weapons to the Communist regime in Beijing; and we are collaborating with it to create a rival to the American system of GPS, which President Chirac refers to as 'technological imperialism'.
I hope it will also be like this in other cases. (PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the Danube Strategy.
Written explanations of vote I welcome the European Council's conclusions of 18-19 June 2009 in which it asks the European Commission to draw up a European strategy for the Danube Region by 2011.
I am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution presented here.
It is also important to bring this strategy into line with the EU 2020 Strategy and the Commission report entitled 'Regions 2020', to tackle the major challenges that Europe is currently facing, such as globalisation, demographic trends, climate change and energy use and supply.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament joint resolution on the Danube, proposing that a European strategy be drawn up for this region as a matter of the utmost urgency.
For all of these reasons, I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution for an EU strategy for the Danube Region.
Such a strategy will promote economic and social cohesion in those regions and promote territorial cohesion without jeopardising any of them.
in writing. - (PL) The strategy for the Danube Region which we have prepared, and which we have voted on today, makes it possible to promote regional and cross-border cooperation.
