That does not make us lose sight of the main objective, which is SIS II, which will guarantee greater security in border controls.
It will not be an enormous delay, and I can tell the rapporteur and Parliament already that in February 2007 the Commission will submit a definite proposal for the final date for developing SIS II.
The mandate granted by the Council to the Commission to develop SIS II finishes in a few days, on 31 December.
The proposal to extend the deadline to December 2007 is the optimistic version.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, as it is known, is a database which allows the appropriate authorities in the Member States to cooperate and to exchange information for the purpose of creating an area without internal border controls.
That is why, as early as in December of 2001, exactly five years ago, the Council assigned the Commission with setting up a second generation SIS II system.
I hope that the Commission will learn some lessons from the delay in implementing the SIS II system and that, in the future, it will work more efficiently on projects that are important to the European Union as a whole.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, a properly functioning information system is the basis for a successful exchange of data between the Member States.
The delays in the implementation of the SIS II system are very dangerous in the view of the new Member States.
