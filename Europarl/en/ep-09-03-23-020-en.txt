The EU and India launched negotiations in June 2007 on what is termed a free trade agreement, but what many would probably more correctly call a preferential trade agreement.
When we talk about the European Union-India free trade agreement, it is important to take into account the general context and complexity of our strategic relations with India, including the 1994 Cooperation Agreement and the Joint Action Plan, to mention but two of the major initiatives and dialogues that we have established with India.
The impact and sustainable development assessment is currently in its final phase and should be available in April, in other words, in time to support the negotiations under way.
Six negotiating sessions have been held since the launch in June 2007, with the sixth session taking place last week in Delhi, from 17 to 19 March.
The presentation is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 March 2009.
The EU's trade in goods with India has more than doubled in value between 2000 and 2007.
In 2007, EU investment amounted to 65% of all investment in India.
