One example of these threats: in paragraph 10 the report stresses a need for a major EU contribution to promote regional disarmament.
The von Wogau report clearly presents our final objective.
There is an urgent need to provide the same access to space-based intelligence systems for all Member States on a common basis. (CS) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is often said in Europe that there is a crisis of public confidence in the European project and in European politics.
Though we apparently agree that, in order to deal with the current challenges, numerous armies of a national nature are no longer necessary, we still have a European Union with 25 national armies, whose personnel amount to some two million people, whose main duty is to defend the Member States' borders and interests and which jointly cost more than EUR 160 million per year.
The report presented this in a well-balanced manner, and that is why we will gladly support it in tomorrow's vote. (PL) Madam President, today's debate on the implementation of a European Security Strategy is one of the more important debates concerning the future of the European Union.
There should be no competition between NATO and the European Union in the field of security and defence policy.
The figures from Eurobarometer are clear: 77% of Europeans support a European security and defence policy.
