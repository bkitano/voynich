author. - Madam President, the tropical rainforests in Cameroon and the Congo are precious and we must welcome this voluntary agreement to address the sustainability of the harvesting of the timber that they contain.
The widespread removal of tropical timber is driven by an insatiable appetite for products to grace our homes.
What we want is an agreement that contributes to the conservation and sustainable management of our biodiversity resources.
Thirdly, we must ensure - and I agree with Catherine Bearder who mentioned this - that appropriate funds are available to properly implement this agreement.
author. - Madam President, we agree with the general approach of Yannick Jadot to this issue.
I shall try to answer a couple of questions that have been put to me.
Between 2002 and 2008, the EU contributed EUR 544 million to forestry in general in the developing world, some of it directed to FLEGT work in individual countries.
The Commission has so far spent a further EUR 35 million to support FLEGT more generally, and we will spend EUR 35 million more between 2011 and 2013.
