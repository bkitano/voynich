The transitory system that has been used since 1993 is continuously being extended, and we all know that this situation is not a sustainable one and that we need to find a more lasting solution.
The report I am in charge of urges the Commission to ensure that the process is an efficient one and that we do everything in our power to ensure that, firstly, the new system will improve the internal market's effectiveness; secondly, that this new system reduces the burdens on the business sector; and thirdly, that it combats fraud as effectively as possible.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, David Casa, for his constructive and quick report on the Commission's proposal to extend by five years the existing rules on the minimum standard VAT rate.
I hope that this consultation will give a clear idea of the priorities for the future of VAT.
However, until this strategy has been finalised, I believe that the decision to extend the transitional provision on the minimum VAT rate until 31 December 2015 is intended to reassure the business community, prevent structural imbalances in the European Union and encourage harmonisation of fiscal legislation.
I would therefore like to use my speech to make a call for the review of the entire VAT system, which I think would be in the interests both of our economies and of our businesses.
Mr President, yes, I am indeed glad that the Commissioner has understood that we are calling for the drawing up of a Green Paper without delay in order to fuel a more in-depth debate on the Commission's proposals.
However, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that we are eager for it to present us with proposals as promptly as possible, as this will allow us to share our own ideas in turn, and ultimately guarantee a fairer system for everyone.
