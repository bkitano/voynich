European Action on victims of terrorism (debate) The next item is the Commission statement on European Action on victims of terrorism.
Since 2004, the Commission has been providing financial assistance to a number of projects aimed at providing victims and their families with the aid and the social or psychological support they need.
We have devoted a budget of EUR 200 000 to it.
The total funds allocated for preparation for and prevention of terrorist attacks will amount to EUR 21 420 000 next year.
These are the ten commandments that I propose for a common policy for the victims of terrorism. (EL) Madam President, the attacks in Madrid and London and the recent attacks in my country, Greece, demonstrate the extent of the problem of terrorism.
It targets not only the direct victims and their families, which are also directly injured, but also society as a whole.
Indeed, the European Union must equip itself with exemplary legislation on the protection and assistance of victims of terrorism as part of this multiannual Stockholm Programme.
