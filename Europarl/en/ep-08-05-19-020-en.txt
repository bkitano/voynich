Protection of the environment through criminal law (debate) The next item is the report by Mr Nassauer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law - C6-0063/2007 -.
Thank you, Mr Nassauer.
While the Commission would have wished to approximate the level of penalties, the Court of Justice judgment of October 2007 makes that impossible on the legal basis of the Treaty, and the Court's ruling must be respected.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 21 May 2008.
