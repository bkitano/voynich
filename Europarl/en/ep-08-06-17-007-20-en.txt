We have been checking during the course of the votes and I think all the groups agree that you may mistakenly have announced that Amendment 27 was carried.
Amendment 27 could not have been carried.
Amendment 27 was accepted; Amendment 92 was therefore invalidated.
I am glad that you do not hold me responsible. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say that the chance you have given us to vote again on Amendment 27 has made it possible to put right an injustice, because in this way we were able to vote for Amendment 92 which, if Amendment 27 had really been adopted, would have lapsed.
