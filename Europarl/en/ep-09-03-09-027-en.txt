Commission Reports on Competition Policy 2006 and 2007 (short presentation) The next item is a brief presentation of the report by Jonathan Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the reports on competition policy 2006 and 2007.
In this case, because of timing factors, the reports for 2006 and 2007 have been brought together but - taking up one of the points mentioned by Commissioner Barrot a little earlier - it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly, since we in fact began the exercise of considering the report some time ago.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Evans, first I wish to thank you on behalf of Neelie Kroes and the entire Commission.
It should never be forgotten, Mr Evans, that these competition rules are also there to stimulate productivity and to allow us to come back in even better condition after the crisis. 2009 must be a year of cooperation.
