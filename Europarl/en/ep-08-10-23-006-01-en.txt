Draft general budget of the European Union - 2009 budget (vote) - Before the vote rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, the explanation process is the same as it is every year.
Firstly, as already indicated in the voting list, the vote on amendment 783 to budget line 22 02 04 02 only concerns payment appropriations.
Secondly, the explanations concerning the global energy assessment do not belong on budget line 08 03 01, where they have mistakenly been included, but on line 08 05 01.
Therefore the vote on amendment 936 to line 08 03 01 must be made without the comments on the global energy assessment.
Thirdly, the reinstatement of resources in the Preliminary Draft Budget for the decentralised agencies with their titles in lines 1 and 2 also includes, of course, the reinstatement of their establishment plans.
This concerns the sentence which begins 'The Commission may' up to 'and to transfer to the internal auditor of the Commission' in the following amendments: Amendment 994 to line 19 04 01, amendment 1011 to line 21 02 01, amendment 1015 to line 21 03 01, amendment 1016 to line 21 04 01, amendment 1026 to line 23 02 01 and amendment 785 to line 23 02 02.
Fifthly and finally, the budget line 19 06 06 with the title 'Consular cooperation' is not included in the amendments, although it was adopted as part of the amending letter No 1/2009.
Mrs Haug, as we have great confidence in you, we can now vote on this. (Parliament approved the rapporteur's proposal) Before the vote on Amendment 111 - (FR) Mr President, I do not believe we have voted on the second part of 106.
