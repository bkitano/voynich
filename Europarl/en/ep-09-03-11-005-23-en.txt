rapporteur. - Madam President, it is just to change the wording in Paragraph 93 concerning sound state finance to 'as soon as possible', instead of 'when economic conditions allow', as agreed with the shadow rapporteurs. (FR) Madam President, this is a purely technical amendment.
I mean by this, ladies and gentlemen, that I gave the floor to Mr Schulz in accordance with Rule 141 of the Rules of Procedure.
