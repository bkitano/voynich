This is why the Commission is in favour of market makers filing this notification with their own competent authority only, instead of with potentially 25 authorities.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his words about the report.
Quite clearly we are entering a very dangerous time: we have two years in which to get this right, to measure the value of equivalence and reach convergence with countries around the world.
Therefore, the European Commission must take action in support of the application of such standards in developing countries, promote their quality and European nature and in this way develop an image of the European financial market and offer various solutions (not only in a technical sense).
The second has to do with the question as to how we should apply the IFRS standards in future, an aspect that will become more and more important.
It is very important that the European Parliament strengthens its powers in those areas.
If there is goodwill on all sides we will reach a satisfactory end, but in any event if we do not reach a satisfactory outcome then, as we say in my country, nothing is lost.
