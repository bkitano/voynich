Sakharov Prize 2010 (announcement of the winner) Colleagues, I have just come from the Conference of Presidents.
We are fighting for human rights in our Parliament on behalf of 500 million citizens.
Following a substantial debate today involving very wide and deep discussions, the Conference of Presidents decided to award the 2010 Sakharov Prize for the freedom of thought to Mr Guillermo Fariñas. (Applause) Guillermo Fariñas is an independent journalist and political dissident.
I sincerely hope that, together with Guillermo Fariñas, another Cuban laureate from 2005, the Ladies in White - Las Damas de Blanco - will also be able to collect the Sakharov Prize in person.
