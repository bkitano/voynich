I would also remind you that, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament must be submitted with the consent of the nominees and that they may only be made by a political group or by at least 40 Members.
Concerning the issue of one seat, at the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents our new President should propose an early debate on our seats and our calendar for 2008.
Then we could have one fixed hour of well-organised voting in all areas of joint decision-making, allowing us to reach the magic 393 votes behind our amendments.
Last year we had 5 500 votes in which very few Members can say what they voted on.
On representation abroad, so far, Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs has sent 58 representatives to negotiate the Constitution with the national parliaments.
In 7 of 11 meetings, the 'No' side was not even represented at all.
These figures do not proportionately represent the 137 Members who voted 'No' to the Constitution.
I have particular recollections of working together extremely well with our former President Klaus HÃ¤nsch.
This European Union of ours has 500 million people, and it needs reforms.
