It all began in 1989, when his country proclaimed its independence and in 1990, when the Hungarian Parliament declared 23 October a Hungarian national holiday, demonstrating that the legacy of the 1956 Revolution is still alive amongst us.
Now, after 50 years, with a historical perspective, and after the fall of the Soviet communist regime, we can clearly see the historic importance of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the fight for freedom.
The world can now celebrate its generous sacrifice: Austria, which had just been liberated, opening the borders for 160 000 Hungarian refugees; the blood donations in Poland to help to rescue those wounded in the fight for freedom; the tens of thousands of Hungarian refugees who found new homes in various countries around the world.
It is to the credit of 1956 that the world looks upon Hungary with a positive mind.
The communists could build the Berlin Wall in 1961 and use military intervention to crush the Prague Spring reform movement in 1968.
The struggles in Poland and Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland again, headed by the Solidarity trade union, from the 1980s onwards, were concurrently struggles for basic democratic freedoms and for limiting Soviet influence.
The parallel lesson of 1956 and 1989 is that in both cases, history surpassed the aspirations that wanted more freedom within a socialist system.
The greatness of Premier Imre Nagy lies in the fact that he recognised that.
And he would rather die than retreat. (DE) On 22 October, the eve of the revolution, Heads of State, prime ministers and other distinguished guests took part in a gala event at the Budapest State Opera.
By the end of 1956, more than 153 000 Hungarians had fled to Austria, and another 30 000 followed them later.
The first Hungarian refugees arrived in Germany on 2 November 1956.
On behalf of the Hungarian people, I would like to thank you for that. (HU) The commemoration of 1956 has to remember the liberation experienced at the time, with its sense of elemental and pure joy.
