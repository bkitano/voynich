It arises from an amendment to our Rules tabled by just two Members of the European Parliament - Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering - who considered that this would facilitate the participation of Members of Parliament from across 27 Member States - as we will be in January - in positions of responsibility in Parliament.
When Parliament had 500 Members, we had five Quaestors, in other words, virtually one for every 100 MEPs.
If we stuck with that ratio with the proposed 780 Members, we would have a very high number.
I believe that the complexity of developments and of the problems that will arise in the House with 25 languages - I am now including Catalan and Irish, for example - that this complexity affecting the conduct of business and decisions justifies increasing that number from five to six for a time.
