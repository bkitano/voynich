Thank you, Mrs Figueiredo.
Mrs Bilbao Barandica, this concerned a point of order under the terms of Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure which allows the agenda to be changed.
I will therefore return to the agenda. (The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved) (DE) Mr President, I believe that Rule 140 is not applicable to the urgency procedure and I would therefore ask you to have this checked by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, because it could set a dangerous precedent.
