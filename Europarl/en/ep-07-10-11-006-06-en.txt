Composition of the European Parliament (vote) - Report: Alain Lamassoure, Adrian Severin - Before the vote: rapporteur. - Madam President, I would just like to make a clarification, because several different terms are used in the report and in the amendments, and I would like everybody to know what we are going to vote on.
This means I have made a mistake, and therefore I apologise to those involved.
However, where figures are concerned, for the PPE-DE Group the instruction changes to a free vote, and along with my co-rapporteur I invite all those who wish to support the proposals of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs to vote against Amendment 1. (Applause) (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is still not clear whether Amendment 1 is compatible with Amendment 51.
If Amendment 1 is compatible with Amendment 51, as I believe it is, the Italian delegation will vote in favour of Amendment 1, but we do need this clarification.
