Firstly, on Amendment 328 to line 22 02 02 'Transition and institution-building assistance to potential candidate countries': this is accepted with + EUR 2 million for commitments and payments.
These EUR 2 million are taken from line 19 05 01 'Cooperation with industrialised non-member countries'.
Secondly, EUR 5 million in commitments and payments is added to line 16 02 02: 'Multimedia actions'.
Thirdly, EUR 400 000 in commitments and payments is added to line 15 04 47: 'European Year for Intercultural Dialogue'.
With regard to the amounts in reserve which are released: Amendment 302 to line 16 03 02 - 'Local actions' - the reserve is lifted; Amendment 251 on 'European Schools' - line 26 01 50 23; lastly, Amendment 330 to 28 01 01 - 'Staff in active employment in the audit policy area'.
Finally, to take account of a problem on pre-accession assistance which arose from the Council's reading, and which we were not able to pick up quickly enough, we ask the Commission at the end of paragraph 25 of the resolution, 'to present a transfer request or amending budget during the course of 2007 if the amounts foreseen in the 2007 budget turn out to be insufficient'.
This concerns budget line 05 05 01 01.
