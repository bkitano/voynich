I should nevertheless like to say this: the report on which we are voting today, the Mikko report on concentration and pluralism in the media, is the first report which we are approving under this procedure, which prevents us from having a full debate, which prevents us from tabling amendments, on a day when there has been a serious, very serious, attack on freedom of expression in Italy, with the announcement of the sacking of 25 journalists from the only television channel over which Berlusconi does not at present hold sway.
Mr President, in Italy, there are three state television channels: Rai 1, Rai 2 and Rai 3, there is the Mediaset group and then in Italy there is LA7 ... (Protests from the centre and the left) Ladies and gentlemen, there is no reason to get worked up.
