Deposit-guarantee schemes (debate) The next item is the report by Christian Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on deposit-guarantee schemes.
The third part deals with future crisis and risk management.
If Member States with ex post systems were now to be asked to carry out a complete restructuring of their deposit-guarantee schemes at great expense, it would be necessary to analyse whether the diversity of the schemes and the accompanying unacceptable and expensive market distortions are at all justifiable in the internal market.
The recent financial turmoil provides evidence that maintaining deposits or confidence is crucial during a financial crisis.
Member States may take immediate action if their coverage level proves to be inappropriate.
The ECOFIN conclusions of 9 October are clear on this point.
However, sometimes, arrangements between schemes in different Member States have not worked in practice, and we support the EFDI's efforts to achieve a voluntary model agreement.
So it is very welcome that the Commission is studying this matter, analysing whether there are competition distortions and making possible future recommendations in this area, especially on refundability and transferability of ex ante deposit guarantees already paid in money.
Before we resort to legislative measures, the Member States should first eliminate remaining weaknesses in their deposit-guarantee schemes.
I think a good achievement with this report by Mr Ehler is that we have achieved that conclusion.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
