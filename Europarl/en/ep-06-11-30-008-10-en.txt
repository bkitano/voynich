Research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013, FP7) (vote) - Before the vote: draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - I just wish to inform the House that the compromise package of amendments, which is in the first block, and amendment 15 represent a hard-negotiated compromise with the Council and the Commission.
Adopting any other amendment might put that at risk by reopening the procedure, which would be a matter of great concern to the research community. (Applause) (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tabled two amendments: numbers 47 and 48.
The second part of the other amendment has been declared inadmissible, that is to say the part that specifies today's date, 30 November, as the deadline for destroying embryos used for the procurement of stem cells.
Thank you, Mrs Breyer.
The position is simple.
