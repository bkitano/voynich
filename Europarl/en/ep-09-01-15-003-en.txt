I think that in the future, we will have to look at other forms of diet across the European Union, because what I want to say to you quite clearly this morning is that while I am a great supporter of the Mediterranean diet, I do not come here as the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture just to support the Mediterranean diet, because there are other diets across Europe that are equally as good but have different qualities and different food.
As MEPs, you will know that the White Paper entitled 'A Strategy for Europe on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues', which was adopted by the European Commission on 30 May 2007, brings together all of the Community policies that can contribute towards improving eating habits and preventing obesity.
It has been scientifically proven - this conclusion was reached in a September 2008 edition of the British Medical Journal - that the Mediterranean diet helps to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, of type 2 diabetes - the contemporary European epidemic - and of cancer, and to decrease the effects of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

These statistics are alarming.
