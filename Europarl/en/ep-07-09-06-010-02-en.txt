Bangladesh suffered 15 years of military dictatorship and, although civilian government was restored in 1990, the country is far from having a true democracy.
author. - Mr President, like my colleague Robert Evans, I also represent, in London, our region, over 150 000 constituents of Bangladeshi origin.
author. - (SV) Mr President, I think that Bangladesh has been a country of great hope.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the situation in Bangladesh is certainly worrying.
There is concern, nevertheless, that the Election Commission's work programme presented in July 2007 will not be completed on time.
We should recall that the European Union's observation mission came to an end on 22 January, when the United Nations also withdrew its support.
It is particularly important to exert pressure on the authorities to secure the freedom of the students arrested during the protests of 28 August 2007.
The individuals arrested include two former prime ministers, 160 leading politicians and over 100 000 civilians.
Mr President, it is obviously a good thing that the human rights situation in Bangladesh is being exposed here in the northern hemisphere.
The European Union, by the way, has a commendable history of constructive engagement on human rights and democracy with Bangladesh, and the decision to send an EU election observation mission to scrutinise the abortive 2007 elections and to suspend the mission in the face of the Awami League boycott and compelling evidence of efforts to rig the polls, is an example of that engagement.
Parliament will recall that profound misgivings over the list prepared for the 2007 elections were a key factor in the postponement of the polls.
In an encouraging move, the Bangladesh Election Commission has now announced a schedule for consultations with the 15 principal parties in the country.
In conclusion, the European Commission remains optimistic that Bangladesh is on track to hold credible parliamentary elections in 2008.
