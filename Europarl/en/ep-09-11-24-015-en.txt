We here in the European Parliament have always taken rail safety very seriously.
The plan was adopted at the conference on rail safety organised - as I said earlier - by the Commission on 8 September 2009.
The task force has a specific two-step work programme which requires results to be published in December 2009 and June 2010.
As for the ERTMS, it is in place and has given positive results on over 2 000 kilometres.
The recent implementation plan that you referred to must be binding and must not be delayed due to financial or national considerations.
In the North-South system, there are two railroads which are similar - the one in Poland and the one in Italy.
Safety costs money, of course, but we need investment in the infrastructure and in safety.
The extension of priority projects 6 and 17 to Bucharest and Constan≈£a, the construction of a rail corridor for freight transport on this route, as well as the implementation of the ERTMS, should become priority TEN-T projects.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that many answers to the requests made during this debate were given at the conference on railway safety held on 8 September, which I convened immediately after the accidents in Viareggio and the Netherlands, precisely to give a signal regarding the strong commitment on the part of the Commission and the European institutions to take action in the very sensitive sector of railway safety.
With regard to passengers' rights in the rail sector, there is legislation that will enter into force on 3 December this year.
The EU has already adopted Directive 2007/59/EC on the certification of train drivers, and the European driving licence for train drivers already exists: it will enter into force on 3 December this year.
As I confirmed in my reply to the question, I believe that the ERTMS system is an important project from the technological viewpoint, in which the European Commission has invested with a view to making all transport in the rail sector safer.
