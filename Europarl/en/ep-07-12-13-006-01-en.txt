The Committee on Budgets voted its second reading amendments, further to the conciliation outcome, on 29 November 2007.
I am pleased to report the agreement reached between our two institutions in the concertation meeting on 23 November, that dealt in full with all the budget proposals for 2008 on which we had agreed by that date.
I therefore note that the budgetary procedure has been completed in accordance with the treaty provisions and the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006.
I also note that, in accordance with Article 13 of the interinstitutional agreement, the Council and Parliament agree to accept the maximum rate of increase of non-compulsory expenditure that comes out of the second reading in Parliament.
The official signature of the budget for the financial year 2008 will be on Tuesday, 18 December, at the plenary session in Brussels.
