Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow, we will vote on the role of vocational education and training in the Europe 2020 strategy.
The goal of the Europe 2020 strategy is precisely to tap this potential in terms of workers and to bring them into the workplace so that the EU, too, can deal with globalisation.
The distinction between education and training, apart from their context in the workplace, will become even less clear in the future.
The second context for this report is the common 2020 objectives that we have set for training, employment and the reduction of the drop-out rate.
We must also ensure that all young people have the right to undergo training.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 7 June 2011, at 12:00.
Written statements (Rule 149) During the current economic and financial crisis where the unemployment rate, especially among young people, has exceeded the 20% mark at EU level and even 30% in some Member States, improving vocational education and training must become a priority for the European Union.
Furthermore, increasing mobility at European Union level through expanding programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci or Youth on the Move can also help improve the EU's ability to respond better to the demand of the European labour market and to have greater potential for development in this area.
We need greater coordination at European level between the education systems in the individual Member States, and, following on from this, cooperation on the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications.
I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training.
