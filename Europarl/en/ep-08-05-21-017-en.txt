In the meantime, as you know, there have been talks between us and on 5 May Parliament received a letter, signed by Commissioner Dimas on your behalf and on behalf of the Commissioner for Research as well, which gave interesting and binding responses to our questions and to our notional opposition to this regulation.

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sacconi, ladies and gentlemen, my Group supports the motion for a resolution.
