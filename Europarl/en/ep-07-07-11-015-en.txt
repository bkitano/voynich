Situation in Pakistan (debate) The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan.
From this decision came the joint EU-Pakistan declaration, adopted in Berlin on 8 February.
The Council is monitoring the situation in Pakistan closely through its permanent contacts with EU embassies in Islamabad.
The Council is also following the case of Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry very closely.
The government is right to address this phenomenon in a decisive manner.
I am pleased to inform Parliament that, on 24 May, we held the first Joint Commission under the third generation Cooperation Agreement in Islamabad.
We have also significantly increased the volume of our cooperation with Pakistan to EUR 200 million over the next four years, notably in the areas of rural development and education.
Another is a possible arrangement between the President and the opposition parties which could result in early parliamentary elections and Musharraf's possible re-election by the new assemblies.
The vote will take place on Thursday 12 July 2007.
Furthermore, I would request the President to abide by the assurances that he gave to the EP Delegation during the December 2006 visit to Pakistan, about the transition to civilian rule and to agreement on building up democratic institutions and most importantly the assurances he gave us on media freedom.
