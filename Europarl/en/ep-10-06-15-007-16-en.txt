The electronic voting system is used as an alternative to a vote with ballot papers.
As you recall, Mr Lambrinidis, at the beginning of this Parliament, there were in fact three ballots in order to elect all the Vice-Presidents on a qualified majority, so that was the procedure we followed on that occasion.
On this occasion, there was only one candidate and, given that he received more than 168 votes, he got more than the qualified majority and is therefore elected on a single vote.
Mr Buzek said there were 334 votes in favour, 287 votes against and 168 abstentions.
In relation to this, it does indeed look as if 789 people voted, and now the explanations that some votes do not count may mean that it is some of the 334 votes in favour which do not count.
You said that 168 was the threshold for a qualified majority.
This is the first time I have heard that 168 votes is a qualified majority in this Parliament.
The fact is that with 621 Members voting, the majority needed to be at least 311.
If the general public throughout the 27 countries are watching, they will have very little respect for this House.
I accept your explanation, Mr President; I accept the explanation of the President.
As one of my fellow Members mentioned, we are being watched by citizens from 27 countries.
