substitute of the author. - (RO) Madam President, the subject we are discussing is a requirement that the Committee on Transport has had for some time and which it submitted to the European Commission in order to present a model for internalization of external costs, applicable to all modes of transport.
In fact, I requested the Commission to present, by June 2008 at the latest, after examining all options - including of costs related to environmental protection, noise, congestions and health - a generally applicable model, transparent and comprehensive, for assessing all external costs, which would define and act as a basis for the subsequent calculation of charges for using infrastructures.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, the Commission carried out a study to collate all publications on the subject and identify the best practices for assessment of external costs.
Secondly, the Commission has started work on an impact assessment in relation to compensation for external costs.
I would add my voice to those of my fellow Members who have asked when we are going to be presented with an actual legislative draft.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I always listen to the House with great interest, but I nevertheless wish to explain a number of points.
