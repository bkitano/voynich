EU-Serbia relations (vote) - Kacin report - Before the vote on Amendment 8 (DE) Mr President, I wanted to say a word on this amendment.
We had to make a correction there, and I ask Mr Sch√∂pflin and other Members to vote in favour, because there was a mistake in the original text. 1992 is the wrong year.
