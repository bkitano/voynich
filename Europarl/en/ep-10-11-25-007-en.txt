Camp Achraf (written declaration) Written declaration No 0075/2010, presented by Alejo Vidal-Quadras, Stephen Hughes, Kristiina Ojuland, Søren Bo Søndergaard and Struan Stevenson, on Camp Ashraf, has been signed by more than a majority of Parliament's component Members.
This sends a very powerful message to the Iraqi authorities to lift the inhuman siege that they have applied against the 3 400 innocent people in Camp Ashraf over recent months.
