In the framework of this reform, the three institutions concluded a joint statement in which they committed themselves to adapt 26 priority basic acts to this new procedure, and the Commission adopted 26 priority alignment proposals at the end of last year.
Consequently, the whole package of the 26 priority alignment proposals could be ready for adoption before the end of this year.
As you know, the Commission made a commitment to review all existing codecision basic legal acts, in addition to these 26 priority acts, with a view to bringing them into line with the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny.
It concerns in total more or less 220 acts.
A third aspect of revising Parliament's scrutiny rights is the revision of the agreement concluded in 2000 between the Commission and Parliament on comitology procedures.
After the adoption of recitals 1 and 2 in committee there were negotiations between Parliament and the Commission, which Mrs Wallstr√∂m referred to, and we tabled a final amendment, Amendment 4, which replaces the current Amendment 2, and establishes a formula for cooperation between the three institutions.
