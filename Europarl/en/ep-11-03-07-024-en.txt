Although there has been some progress, major inequalities within the 27 Member States still persist.
The current situation of global crisis tends to make the situation worse.
On the supply side, the crisis may lead to a reduction in the level of funding for public health, at the same time as it may lead to increased demand for health services.
Points 26, 29 and 53 are also contentious.
Therefore, there are health inequalities not only between Member States, but also between regions in these states.
Inequalities in health are increasing and this is happening in some countries of the European Union, specifically in my country, Portugal.
The mandatory funding of abortions from the public purse deprives healthcare of its moral imperative and debases it to the level of a luxury that cannot be withheld. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even today in the European Union, health inequalities still persist over access to services, treatment and social factors, and this necessitates an integrated response.
However, the European Commission must include in the procedures for monitoring the Europe 2020 strategy differentiated comparative indicators, based on socio-economic status, and take into account age-based discrimination.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is grateful to Parliament for its support for our action to bridge health inequalities and for its recommendations on this important issue.
I would like also to thank, in particular, the rapporteur, Ms Estrela, for her commitment to this cause.
Disparities in health between countries, between regions, between rich and poor, between different ethnic minorities, affect each and every EU Member State and, in many places, they are getting wider.
The vote will take place at midday on Tuesday, 8 March.
