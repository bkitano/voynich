Framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides - Thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides - The placing of plant protection products on the market (debate) The next item is the joint debate on the report by Christa Klaß, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides - C6-0246/2006 -, the report by Irena Belohorská, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, and the report by Hiltrud Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market - C6-0245/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, first let me thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs, Mrs Belohorská and Mrs Klaß, for their exceptionally thorough work.
The monitoring programmes implemented in Member States have exposed traces of pesticides not only in food and animal feed but also in the environment itself, in concentrations exceeding the limits values set by European legislation.
Such measures may include, among others, creating buffer zones, or prohibiting or restricting the use of pesticides.
Other measures envisaged by the thematic strategy have been incorporated or will be incorporated shortly in other legislative acts.
In conclusion, Mr President, let me stress how important an aspect of the proposed directive on the sustainable use of pesticides integrated pest management is.
It is thus particularly important that this element should be maintained in our proposal and should become compulsory in all Member States from 2014.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, we shall be debating a really difficult but important issue today.
let me first of all thank all those who have worked to make this debate possible today, and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer.
The subject has always been difficult.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that plant protection products play an important role in agriculture, crop growing, silviculture and market gardening.
On the basis of a 2001 report by the Commission on the legislation's function and where it can be improved, both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive.
The first priority is indisputably to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health, as well as for the environment.
This will be achieved through a number of provisions: establishing clear, strict criteria for the approval of active substances; giving a central role to the European Food Safety Authority in the assessment of active substances; and obliging farmers to maintain files on the use of plant protection products, to be made available on request to their neighbours and the water industry.
The Member States' authorities will also have to intensify checks on the commercial exploitation and use of plant protection products, and the Commission will examine and verify how effectively Member States are carrying out these checks.
The proposal will thus create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment.
This will avoid dividing the internal market over plant protection products and stop splitting the market over agricultural products.
The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation.
An arbitrary percentage reduction across the entire range of plant protection agents runs counter to the aims of good agricultural practice and integrated pest management.
In those places crop spraying from the air is indispensable.
Plant protection products are expensive, and no farmer will apply more than is absolutely necessary.
I took part in the discussions on these various reports in the Committee on the Environment but it seemed to me that what Mrs Klaß has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position.
rapporteur. - (SK) The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, being a non-legislative political document that accompanies the directive, responds to the fact that the risks of pesticide use are not decreasing.
The National Action Plans containing the Member States' individual targets in terms of risk reduction are the most important part of the whole process.
The Thematic Strategy and the directive must deal with both crop protection measures and biocides.
Although I support the ban on aerial spraying, I accept that it will be possible to grant an exception under certain circumstances, in the absence of a more viable alternative.
The Strategy is not directed against farmers.
I also want to mention Amendments 3 and 5, which deal with residential zones.
Amendment 3 proposes to add the term 'urban': to me this means 'suburban zone' and thus excludes those who live in rural areas.
I also propose to amend paragraph 8 linguistically because the term 'practitioner' is a bad translation; in French it is even 'médecin'.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the privilege of introducing a report that will offer Parliament the opportunity tomorrow to vote for a breakthrough towards greater health, and environmental and consumer protection.
The active substances that are most frequently discovered in concentrations exceeding the EU residue limits should not be marketed any more, because they have thereby proved, I am afraid to say, that they are uncontrollable.
Measured values were up to 200 times higher than the levels normally prescribed for infant and baby food.
Greater transparency for the sake of these vulnerable groups, but also for consumers and people living near farmland, means greater support for Europe as a whole too, because there must be no more prodding about in the dark when it comes to traceability.
People in Europe do not want poison on their plates.
I hope that this regulation will also improve Europe's standing as a business location, because it will make Europe a better place for consumers to live, and it will be universally beneficial - not only to the environment and consumers and in terms of animal welfare, but above all to manufacturers and farmers, since they will receive more incentives to innovate and become more competitive.
In conclusion, I would like to express my warmest thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who have collaborated on this report in a truly cooperative manner.
We need food security, we need food production and we need safe food in Europe.
Pesticides are useful and necessary and without these products it is becoming difficult to feed 6 billion people.
Certainly there is still a great deal to be done to combat the harmful environmental and health effects of pesticides.
I have another comment to make on the use of pesticides.
The compulsory buffer zone of 10 metres from surface water is not a good idea for some Member States.
Surface water is now one of the assessment criteria for approval and on that basis Member States have the right to establish a buffer zone for products themselves.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission proposal on this report had a dual legal basis, namely Article 37(2) on agricultural policy, and Article 152(4)(b) on health protection.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied these proposals.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Mr President, as draftswoman of my Committee's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market, I should like to comment on the proposal.
That is a balanced midway position that protects our consumers while guaranteeing that home-grown fruit and vegetables are affordable as well as being subject to adequate testing.
The provisions proposed in the Breyer report would result in 27 national licensing zones.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FI) Mr President, the subject being discussed, the use and placing on the market of sustainable pesticides, is a very important one.
It embraces both the practice of sustainable agriculture and matters of public health.
Not using pesticides is not necessarily a good option, even as far as public health is concerned.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, this is an important, complex and tricky subject that we are debating today.
The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is, in my view, a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face, and I should like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Irena Belohorská, and to record my appreciation of the close cooperation that went into the drafting of the text.
The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle.
The subject that we are concerned with here is therefore very important.
Therefore, I also believe there is reason to criticise the Commission, particularly because you, Mr Kyprianou, are known (in my country, too) as a man who is very concerned with consumer interests and have done a considerable amount to safeguard the environment and health.
In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted.
I speak on behalf of the entire Socialist Group in the European Parliament and fortunately also on behalf of the vast majority who made their views clear through the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Let me give an example of one crop: maize.
In the UK a maize pesticide is used that contains around 15 active substances.
However, if the Commission's proposals are implemented every country will therefore approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances.
Finally, with regard to the reduction targets, I would like to say to Mr Dimas that it is unbelievably positive that we are getting rid of the most dangerous substances - substances that cause cancer, substances that affect child development, etc.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that a number of Member States have already initiated measures to reduce pesticide-related risks, but trends in pesticide use differ from one country to another.
There is a clear need to harmonise the rules here in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union.
We co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans, setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013.
We thought it was important to put forward this amendment because the question is one that we would wish to see addressed in the interinstitutional discussions after the vote at first reading.
The ALDE Group is thus seeking to achieve a balance, the essence of which is that no single party, whether user or manufacturer, should be penalised but rather that rigorous and consistent legislation should be introduced: allowing pesticide users to protect their crops; allowing manufacturers to sell products that will gradually become less harmful; and allowing consumers not only to eat safe food but also to live in a safe environment.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the three reports that have been presented are inextricably linked.
The European Union is trying to do as much as possible to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and to prevent their accumulation in the soil, in water and in plants.
A great deal has been done in the last few years to minimise these effects.
A particularly important role in this work has been played by research organisations that have created modern preparations that work more selectively.
We should also welcome our fellow Members' efforts to ensure transparency in the provision of information for consumers, who are the 'innocent victims' of these dangerous substances.
Every year, between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into our environment in France.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Belohorská, on her report on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
Like the rapporteur, Mrs Belohorská, I, too, regret that whilst the most important result to be expected from the thematic strategy is the reduction of adverse effects on human health deriving from pesticide use, the strategy deals with this heath impact only marginally.
I believe that it will be up to the Commission to complete the work in this regard in the future.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, in the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns on the one hand and the interests of producers and consumers on the other hand.
You can certainly reduce the total quantity of pesticides, but often it is the most used pesticides that are the least dangerous.
In that case the risks are still more or less equal.
An amendment to create a 10-metre buffer zone has been approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, as we all know, it has long been presumed that a connection exists between pesticides used in agriculture or genetically modified foodstuffs on the one hand and various diseases on the other.
Our support schemes should therefore be rethought, particularly with a view to providing more support for those European farmers who refrain using pesticides.
The greatest challenge, of course, is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and our environment.
It became clear in the discussions prior to the vote in plenary that there are major differences between the Member States in both their practice and their policy approach, so we ended up compromising on certain issues and relying on subsidiarity.
The fact is that plant protection products are an important element of modern-day agriculture.
It leads us to ban active substances which do not pose any problem at all in practice.
That, however, has nothing at all to do with the risks involved in their use.
Our aim for the future should not be to reverse this situation. - (LT) I do not think you could find a single person in this House, in this Parliament, who would claim that ecology, a healthy environment and human health was not important.
We need to achieve this objective in a balanced and sensible way.
On the other hand, there is constant pressure on EU agriculture to be competitive as well as to produce good quality food.
The opinion expressed by the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has satisfied the expectations of all interested parties.
The impact on traditional crops would be huge if 90% of plant protection products were excluded from the market.
This is something that we would like to continue with and I therefore request that my fellow Members vote in favour of an amendment to permit protection zones.
Finally, we have received support from a large majority here in Parliament and subsequently from the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
The report is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union.
Of those 148 substances, only 34 are insecticides, nematocides or acaricides, which are the substances most needed for cultivation in Mediterranean Europe where the level of attack by insects is the highest in the entire Union.
The Commission proposal to divide the European Union into three zones for the mutual recognition of plant protection products should be reinstated.
Without a risk analysis it is impossible to determine the effect of these substances on health or the environment.
It is therefore vital that the ambitious stance taken by the Committee on the Environment should be confirmed in tomorrow's vote on the three reports by Hiltrud Breyer, Christa Klaß and Irena Belohorská.
This baggage could reduce the effectiveness of the measures prepared in these documents. (PL) Madam President, producers who are being forced to create food that looks perfect are introducing pesticides that are harmful not just to the environment and to the economy, but also to human health.
Action plans, integrated management and strict import measures: these are also examples of what is positive in all the reports.
I should like to mention four points in particular.
We want a reduction in the actual impact, based on a scientific risk evaluation.
Secondly, we take a similar view on non-spray zones around watercourses.
Here again we are in favour of a risk-based approach and we feel that the Member States are better able than we are to make responsible choices, based partly on the criteria laid down in the water framework directive.
We are in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would also like to see voluntary mutual recognition between zones.
Finally, we are opposed to the general provision of information to neighbours advocated by Mrs Breyer in her report.
Appropriate checks should be introduced and the import into the EU of agricultural food products produced with the aid of chemicals should be banned. (NL) Madam President, plant protection products are still essential for agricultural production and food supplies in Europe.
The big question when we in Europe take particular measures is what kind of influence this has on competitive relations with the rest of the world.
For example, pavement weed control is 400 times more expensive without chemicals.
It would be very easy, especially with this legislative package, to pick on a particular occupational group and look no further.
It must be established from the outset that all of us in Europe need a functioning agricultural sector, which necessarily entails the use of a certain quantity of plant protection agents.
On specific aspects of the Klaß report, let me say that it is indeed a sound principle to envisage certain reduction targets, but I believe the quantitative approach adopted here is simply too rigid.
An unequivocal ban for CMR1-rated substances may be taken as read, but in the case of CMR2 substances I am also in favour of taking scientific data as a basis for licensing decisions. (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative proposal which we will be asked to vote on aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment by establishing Community models for the sustainable use of pesticides and rules for placing them on the European market.
Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on these three reports.
However, we need to achieve that objective in a balanced way and in a common-sense way, so that we protect human health without penalising agriculture.
Finally, I believe a 10-metre buffer zone is a 'one size fits all' solution and needs to be modified to allow Member States to take local conditions into consideration.
The expert use of these substances is, to be honest, a crucial prerequisite for food production in the modern age.
At the same time, however, the adverse impact of plant production products on the environment, and on watercourses in particular, is a very real one.
For example, Finland has almost 200 000 lakes, hundreds of thousands of other watercourses, and one of the world's most polluted seas.
I am confident that buffer zones suited to each situation and consistent with the Commission's proposals are the right way forward.
Perhaps I should say, rather, that they would not be addressing the problem flexibly or satisfactorily. (DA) Madam President, there are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from our fellow members here today.
There are differences between the countries and it is not possible to create a common European reduction target.
What we are doing is saying that the common European reduction target should be 20%.
However, this may of course mean 30% in some countries and 10% in others.
The national reduction target will be established on the basis of national action plans.
Therefore, we have introduced a treatment frequency index as part of this reduction obligation.
However, it is clear that we cannot talk about mutual obligatory recognition of pesticides simply because there are different geographical, climatic and environmental circumstances in each individual country.
Pesticides are expensive to use and therefore, provided they are used correctly, the less they are used the better it is for competitiveness. (SV) Madam President, time is short and I am speaking primarily to express my support for the co-rapporteur of the Breyer report in the PPE-DE Group, Erna Hennicot-Schoepges.
I think it is very unfortunate that the majority of my group chose to ignore Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges' advice on several important points, and not to support important proposals contained in the report.
Of course, I agree that the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work, but it is not reasonable to conclude that we do not need any information requirement at all.
Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges' proposal here, as a compromise, is well-balanced.
Above all, in our decision we must of course be consistent with the decisions taken by Parliament in relation to the new REACH chemicals legislation.
Another issue on which I support the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, is the proposal on zoning.
I cannot support this approach and believe that the Member States must be allowed to retain a right to refuse different preparations even if countries nearby have given them the green light.
Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive.
Each country should be able to do this, taking into account local conditions and differences.
Those countries that are new members of the European Union often have enormous work to do to catch up as regards the level of development.
A reduction in the use of pesticides in these countries, as compared with the present level of their use, will, in the final analysis, work against us as consumers, unless, in reducing their use, we take into account the present level of use of these products, which is relatively low.
It is a duty to the natural environment to protect these forests, and it is Parliament's responsibility to set out guidelines for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment.
The directive speaks a great deal about the farmer's level of knowledge being the most important factor for the implementation of sustainable use of pesticides.
It is the responsibility of us all to support education and to create the conditions so that this information can reach every farmer.
The guidelines in the directive should encourage rational measures and they should not discourage Member States and farmers.
Permit me to set out briefly the Commission's views on certain important issues that have been raised.
Let me begin with the thematic strategy and, in particular, with the points not covered by the directive.
Finally, the Belohorská report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety puts forward certain additional measures which are especially positive.
I should like first of all to comment on the basic amendments which the Commission can fully accept in principle or in part.
In fact, the overall reduction of the quantity of pesticides does not necessarily entail a corresponding reduction in risk: the level of risk varies from one substance to another.
The Commission can in principle accept the laying down of a minimum width for the buffer zones to be created in fields located next to water courses, because this will bring additional environmental gains.
The Commission can also accept certain useful clarifications on other issues, such as technical training and certification.
There are, however, amendments which the Commission cannot endorse.
Fourthly, the Commission cannot support the addition of a reference to Article 152(4) of the Treaty, since the proposed directive is clearly focused on environmental protection, which already includes public health issues.
Madam President, the Commission can accept 121 amendments of the 166 that were tabled; of these it can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, let me begin by reminding Members of the EU's current fundamental policy to promote and support healthy eating.
One comment I should like to make, although not directly connected with the subject under discussion, is on imported products: I stress that they are also monitored for pesticide residues thanks to another regulation on the maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues.
More generally, approval criteria are a very important part of the legislation.
The Commission is of the view that the proposed criteria ought to ensure a high level of protection without making plant protection unworkable or dysfunctional.
let us at the same time strive towards a single, market, internal market, thus avoiding the anomaly of a single market for agricultural products on the one hand, and a divided market for plant protection products on the other.
If we bear in mind particular features relating to climate and soil, division into separate zones is inevitable.
Whereas Member States might act to protect themselves and on the other hand, during the decision-making procedure which needs the approval of the first Member State of the zone, experts from other Member States will be able to play an active part in the licensing procedure and by doing so will be able to assess the circumstances for the entire zone.
Therefore, the special features and the need to protect water resources are taken clearly into account in the new regulation's proposed procedure.
As I have said, there are over 250 amendments, and there is no time to analyse them in detail.
Klass report The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 17, 26, 49, 52, 53, 60, 61, 66, 68, 76, 94, 95, 97, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 115 and 117.
The Commission can accept in principle or in part Amendments 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 54, 56, 59, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 70, 71, 74, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 87, 90, 92, 93, 100, 101, 110, 112, 113, 114, 116, 118, 119, 122, 126, 128, 129, 130, 131, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 160, 163, 164 and 165.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, 5, 16, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 32, 37, 40, 41, 46, 55, 57, 58, 69, 72, 73, 77, 84, 86, 88, 89, 91, 96, 98, 99, 102, 104, 120, 121, 123, 124, 125, 127, 132, 138, 139, 157, 158, 159, 161 and 162.
The Commission reserves its position on Amendment 166.
Breyer report The Commission can accept, or accept subject to rewording, Amendments 9, 11, 20, 22, 26, 29, 31, 32, 33, 36, 41, 43, 45, 49, 51, 56, 57, 64, 67, 75, 78, 79, 82, 84, 92, 93, 96, 102,107, 112, 114, 119, 124, 130, 131, 140, 145, 153, 155, 156, 157, 159, 160, 167, 170, 181, 184, 190, 195, 196, 197, 201, 203, 206, 212, 213, 215, 217, 220, 254, 258, 274, 282, 283, 286 and 301.
The Commission can accept Amendments 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27, 34, 39, 46, 50, 53, 54, 59, 61, 62, 63, 66, 76, 77, 80, 87, 89, 94, 95, 98, 99, 100, 108, 109, 115, 116, 121, 122, 123, 133, 134, 136, 149, 163, 169, 175, 176, 177, 180, 183, 188, 189, 193, 199, 209, 218, 225, 233, 243, 244, 248, 251, 252, 268, 279, 284, 290, 296, 297, 300, 302 and 305, in principle or in part.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 23, 28, 30, 35, 37, 38, 40, 42, 44, 47, 48, 52, 55, 58, 60, 65, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 81, 83, 85, 86, 88, 90, 91, 97, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 110, 111, 113, 117, 118, 120, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 132, 135, 137, 138, 139, 141, 142, 143, 144, 146, 147, 148, 150, 151, 152, 154, 158, 161, 162, 164, 165, 166, 168, 171, 172, 173, 174, 178, 179, 182, 185, 186, 187, 191, 192, 194, 198, 200, 202, 204, 205, 207, 208, 210, 211, 214, 216, 219, 221, 222, 223, 224, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 245, 246, 247, 249, 250, 253, 255, 256, 257, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 280, 281, 285, 287, 288, 289, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 298, 299, 303, 304 and 306.
Therefore, when we prepare legislation on the use and on the permitting of pesticides, we have to keep in mind what is in the interests of the different stakeholders.
If we want to achieve tangible pesticide use reduction in Europe, we need effective national plans for reduction, focusing on the local circumstances and using local opportunities.
While here in Strasbourg we have been debating whether a buffer zone of 5 or 10 metres should be established beside watercourses, Hungary has had buffer zones of 50 metres, and in some places even 500 metres, in place for decades.
On the basis of the compromise draft text, this would apply to a mere 29 substances out of more than 600.
Even if there are differences as a result of specific national situations when it comes to voting, we are agreed in this regard.
Ladies and gentlemen, our approach to this issue must be based on scientific analysis.
I cannot support the reports by Mrs Christa Klaß and Mrs Hiltrud Breyer as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
