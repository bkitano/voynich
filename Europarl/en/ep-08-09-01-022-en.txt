Commissioner, the funds earmarked for translation have not been used up for 2008 yet.
The Commission will indeed ensure that the outcome of the workshops which were organised in 2007 will be taken into account in the CFR.
As a result of all this, we need a range of information and it is of course essential that Parliament can do its work, and that it can do this at a very early stage.
That is why - and I will conclude on this very practical point - it is very important that many Members participate in the hearing that the Commission will organise with experts at the beginning of October and in the conference that the French Presidency of the European Union will hold in Paris on 23 and 24 October.
However, I also take the view - and I fully endorse what Hans-Peter Mayer has said on this point, and Jacques Toubon also touched upon this - that this early involvement of the various stakeholders can, of course, only be successful if the legal bases are available in all the languages.
I would also like to inform you of the meetings tabled by the French presidency, which has scheduled two meetings of the Civil Law Committee for 5 September and 3 November, in order to discuss selection of the chapters of the draft academic CFR for the future Commission CFR.
With reference to Mrs van den Burg's remark, I would like to assure you that the consultation process will be broad and inclusive.
