I request that I be given the floor before the vote on Compromise Amendment 10 to explain why the voting order should be changed.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I should like to request that the voting sequence be changed and that Compromise Amendment 10 be put to the vote after we have voted on a number of other identical requests by various Groups that were due to be voted on after Amendment 10.
As regards the voting procedure, Rule 154 explains which amendment is to be dealt with first when there are corresponding or conflicting requests.
If the vote is reversed, Amendment 46 is adopted if it obtains the qualified majority.
If Amendment 46 does not obtain the qualified majority, at that stage we will vote on the compromise and, therefore, our House will have made its choice.
