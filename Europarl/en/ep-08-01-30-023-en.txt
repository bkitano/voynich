rapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, I am grateful to the shadow rapporteur for helping us to end with a good report.
Finally, I cannot support Amendment 4 as such.
With respect to Amendments 13, 14 and 15, I need to reflect further, since the whole question concerning appropriate incentives for fishers to encourage them to adopt an effective discards policy needs to be further studied and assessed before a definitive position is adopted.
It does not think that these now sterile waters are worth EUR 86 million a year.
I think we should remain firm in defending the principle of non-commercialisation of discards as set out in paragraph 32 of the report, as have countries with a longer history in this matter such as Norway.
If this does not occur, I fear that the problem will be considered and then shelved, while all the fishery stocks are devastated. (FR) Madam President, I should also like to say how much I approve of the approach suggested by our rapporteur to remedy the rightly criticised waste of resources in the current practice with discards.
They would be paid - through a regional compensation fund - a token amount, say about EUR 50 a tonne, which would not be enough to encourage targeting these fish and creating the black market that Ms Fraga Est√©vez fears, but would be too much to throw them, dead, back into the water.
I think it is excellent.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 31 January 2008.
