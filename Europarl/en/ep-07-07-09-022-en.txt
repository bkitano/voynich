I can also confirm the Commission's commitment to submit another study to the colegislator before the end of 2008 on the situation in terms of the law applicable to invasion of privacy, which takes account of the rules on freedom of the press and on freedom of media expression.
I believe that we are going to achieve a good agreement, that a majority in Parliament is going to support this proposal and that we will have a new Regulation in the field of non-contractual obligations.
Those of us who have worked in this field have seen that the courts have a general tendency to apply their own law, the 'lex fori'.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007.
