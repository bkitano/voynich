On a day like today in 1945 the soldiers of the Red Army liberated the Nazi extermination camp whose name has become engraved on man's collective memory.
The Holocaust is a great problem for the whole of humanity.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that we observe a minute’s silence. &#160;&#160; Ladies and gentlemen, following that moment of respect in memory of the victims of Auschwitz, the sitting is suspended. &#160;&#160; Mr&#160;President, we have come to an agreement with different groups in order to find a compromise acceptable to the majority.
It is undoubtedly true that we are all faced with a difficult situation, in that on days like today every word must be weighed very carefully.
I therefore ask the House to vote in favour of this amendment. &#160;&#160; Mr&#160;President, after the many debates on this issue, I should like to confirm that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of this oral amendment. &#160;&#160; Mr President, could we have some clarity on this subject?
We would, however, like to stress that some of the discussions that took place on this resolution during preparations for this session were – and are – unworthy.
If you would put Mr&#160;Sonik’s oral amendment and my own oral amendment to the vote – incidentally, the aim of my oral amendment was to supplement the original text and to ensure that the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was rejected once and for all – we would have precisely what we want, namely a text that is in keeping with the dignity of this day. &#160;&#160; Mr&#160;President, Mr&#160;Schulz has said that we must weigh every word today to ensure that it does justice to the victims and to the perpetrators’ responsibility.
I do not wish to drag out the debate on the issue, but I think it important that an Austrian should take the floor of this House today to join other Members in deploring his country’s shared responsibility. &#160;&#160; Mr&#160;President, I should like to voice a strong protest against what Mr&#160;Cohn-Bendit has just said.
We are not going to go back to a debate on the main substance of the issue. &#160;&#160; Mr President, I can clear up Mr&#160;Cohn-Bendit’s confusion.
We are dealing with the oral amendment by the PPE-DE Group and then the amendment by the UEN Group – which Mr Schulz seems to be amending again – but not the rest of the revised amendment by the UEN Group, to which I think Mr Cohn-Bendit is referring. &#160;&#160; Mr&#160;President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that everyone in this House agrees that all those who took part in this crime – whether they were German, Austrian or of other nationalities – should be condemned, and this is conveyed by the phrase ‘Nazi Germany’.
The key point is the responsibility of all those involved, and it is to this responsibility that we must draw people’s attention.
It is obvious that there are some mental reservations and discrimination in this House.
Nonetheless, these protocols are clearly necessary, because there must be legal uniformity and harmony in the enlarged Union.

I voted in favour. &#160;&#160; In welcoming the successful Palestinian election, the European Parliament should firstly emphasise the non-development of democratic structures during Arafat’s time in power.
The man who, in 1993, orchestrated the Oslo Accords has campaigned on the subject of the demilitarisation of the Intifada.
That is what is pointed out in our resolution, which I have voted in favour of, as, at my request, the unacceptable part of paragraph 12, which condemned the indiscriminate terrorist violence from both sides, has been rejected. &#160;&#160; Mr President, I shall be brief.
I also regret that the present resolution does not breathe a word about today’s anti-Semitic terrorism, about today’s anti-Semitic attacks, about the fact that today in our large cities, for example in Antwerp, Jewish people are being attacked by Arabs and Islamists who are today’s anti-Semites.
By remembering the grim past that the European Union has grown from it can help guide us in the most appropriate direction for the future. &#160;&#160; The real subject of the resolution I have voted in favour of is not only Auschwitz but also Dachau, Mathausen and those 23 concentration camps that give chilling and resounding echo to the nature of mankind, characterised as we are by oceans of darkness, as well as of light.
Even the parties represented in this Parliament who can be associated most with the Nazi past have not voted against the resolution but abstained, one of the arguments being that my group is also one of the parties submitting the resolution.
Upon them is the gaze of the world and of the inhabitants of this century, 60 years after the Holocaust.
My heart and spirit are in Auschwitz today, with them and all the others, those who did not return.
Such a process would also cover procedures and practices for issuing visas. &#160;&#160; Mr President, for 16 years now the family of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane has campaigned for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his murder.
The European Parliament must make clear to the British Government that in order to comply with Article 2, any tribunal must as a minimum have the characteristics identified by Judge Cory.
I move that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should take up the matter, and that Parliament should hold a debate on practising euthanasia on children. &#160;&#160; Mr President, a few days ago in Cyprus a terrible, atrocious crime took place.
I had a very important oral amendment to the resolution on Auschwitz.
I would like to place on record that on this day we reverently honour the Jewish victims of Auschwitz and the other victims, but it should be put in very bold letters that the disabled were there from beginning to end and were killed for no other reason than that they were not perfect, which is what Hitler’s Reich was looking for. &#160;&#160; Mrs Sinnott, the Presidency would beg your forgiveness because we did not notice that you were asking for the floor for an oral amendment.
