Syria: the case of Muhannad Al Hassani I have received six motions for a resolution concerning Syria: the Muhannad Al Hassani case (Rule 122).
Syrian prisons still contain, however, people such as Dr Al Labwani, Dr Al Bunni and, now, Mr Al Hassani.
author. - Mr President, Muhannad Al Hassani is another human rights defender arbitrarily detained by the Syrian authorities.
author. - Mr President, Syria is an important country in the Middle East and has a vital role to play in reducing the ability of Iran to support terrorist actions, via its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas, against Israel.
The detention of Muhannad Al Hassani as a leading human rights defender is alarming.
author. - (FI) Mr President, I am pleased that we have had the courage to put the spotlight on the human rights situation in Syria at this point in time.
We in Parliament last intervened in a similar one in 2007.
Mr Al Hassani must be released.
