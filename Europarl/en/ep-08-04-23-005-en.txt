Formal sitting - Slovenia Spoštovani gospod predsednik Republike Slovenije.
Slovenia joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and currently holds the Council Presidency.
The fathers of this vision - Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and others - probably could not even imagine that, 51 years after the formation of the European Communities, in a highly integrated European Union following its major expansion in the year 2004, Slovenia, as the first country among the new Member States, would be the presiding country and the Slovenian President would be addressing the European Parliament.
The European Commission has established special objectives, which make it possible for the European Union to play a leading role worldwide.
In this instance, under the proposal by the European Commission the European Union would even be prepared to achieve a 30% reduction over the same period.
The place is known.
The Union must also play a more powerful role in worldwide efforts for human rights.
The European Union should also support those emerging democracies around the world that are truly committed to human rights.
Ladies and gentlemen, in its different forms international activity for human rights can be effective if it rises from a solid foundation, from a principled respect for human rights at home.
The objective of the common European asylum system up to the year 2010 appears to be both ambitious and urgent.
The European Union must strengthen its role in its high level dialogue with the United Nations regarding migration.
Your presence here and your speech have made it clear that Slovenia and the Slovenian Presidency under Prime Minister Janus Janša - and I see two ministers sitting here: Janez Lenarčič and Janez Podobnik - want to work closely with the European Parliament.
