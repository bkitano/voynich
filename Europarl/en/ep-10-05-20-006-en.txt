In relation to this responsible discussion among the chairs of our political groups, I have decided to submit a proposal that the debate be postponed.
At lunchtime yesterday, during discussions in our respective groups, we realised that time was short.
In the meantime, we have received a letter from Guy Verhofstadt; that is what made us decide to request a simple three-week postponement.
