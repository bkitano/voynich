author. - (DE) Mr President, 10 December 2006 was International Human Rights Day.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven away or have fled in the face of rioting.
However, the Junta chief, General Than Shwe, remained, along with his deputy, Maung Aye.
Many thousands are political prisoners and the Sakharov prize winner, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest for the last 16 years.
We call on China and other countries to finally discontinue aid for the military Junta and to participate in international measures designed to bring about positive changes in Burma.
Even then, the words repression, ruling military junta and disregard for human rights occurred frequently in what I had to say.
I wish that China and India would play a similar role in future so that the Burmese regime will move towards democracy.
author. - Mr President, Commissioner, in recent years Burma has regularly been on the EU's human rights agenda.
Paragraph 9 states that we want to see the sanctions widened, but we must always target them against the specific individuals in the regime and avoid doing harm to the people of Burma, because the suffering of the people must be our main concern, not our distaste for the democratic standards of the regime itself.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, a year and a half has passed since the latest resolution of the European Parliament condemning the infringement of human rights in Myanmar.
It is exactly 15 years since the European Parliament awarded Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi the Sakharov Prize.
In the same way, political transition is inconceivable so long as the present regime's political opponents are in prison or deprived of their liberty, as is still the case of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi and more than 1 000 of the regime's opponents.
The transition in Burma must respect human rights.
Mr President, may I say on my personal behalf that I have particularly appreciated these debates on human rights, especially the debate on Burma.
