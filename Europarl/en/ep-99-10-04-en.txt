Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 17 September.
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of the sitting of 17 September have been distributed.
Thank you, Mrs Maes.
Thank you, Mr Speroni.
Madam President, under Rule 111 of the European Parliament' s Rules of Procedure, I propose an amendment to the agenda of this part-session to include a statement by the Commission about the French Government' s refusal to lift the beef ban and its decision to stop UK beef crossing its territory, which is a vital route into Spain and Italy.
Madam President, in my opinion, Parliament should not waste this opportunity of issuing a statement on the mandate for the round of talks with the World Trade Organisation, because the Council of Ministers will give this mandate to the Commission on 13 October, and it would be completely wrong if this mandate were given without knowing the European Parliament' s opinion.
Thank you, Mr MacCormick.
