It is correct that Article 229 of the treaty requires a session of the European Parliament to take place on the second Tuesday in March.
My group's amendment aims to move the Strasbourg week from week 10 to week 11.
I think that, despite its ambiguous wording, Amendment 4 should have been declared inadmissible because it contradicts the treaties and, even more so, the interpretation of these treaties that has been given very clearly in a judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, which provides that the current number of part-sessions in Strasbourg must be maintained.
I must inform you before voting that the Presidency believes that Amendment 2 is in breach of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, therefore, declares Amendment 2 to be inadmissible.
Article 229 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the European Parliament, and I quote: 'shall meet without requiring to be convened, on the second Tuesday in March'.
The Conference of Presidents has approved a calendar proposal for 2011 that includes a part-session period from 7 to 10 March, thus complying with Article 229 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Amendment 2 proposes that this part-session period be postponed to the following week.
Article 229 refers to a specific day, which is the second Tuesday in March.
