They are to be treated under the 1951 Refugee Convention and no one - I repeat, no one - should be forced to return to Iran.
In short, this is about the individual human rights of the people in Camp Ashraf.
author. - Mr President, this morning we will be voting on a joint motion for a resolution co-signed by four political groups on the situation of the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq.
In two previous resolutions in 2007 and 2008, our Parliament confirmed the legal status of the Ashraf inhabitants under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
The Iraqi Government has also screened every one of the people in Ashraf - this took place during April this year.
author. - Mr President, the situation of Camp Ashraf, home to 3 500 members of the main democratic opposition of Iran, the PMOI, has been of great concern for some time and has been the subject of several resolutions in this House in recent years.
I think we should understand clearly that these are contrary to the security of the residents of Ashraf and we should vote against them.
Almost 4 000 people, members of the Iranian opposition, are in imminent danger of being deported by the Iraqi authorities back to Iran, whose regime has already executed more than 22 000 of their friends.
Whether people support or criticise the PMOI, in a human rights debate no one in this Chamber should disagree with amendments which seek to support human rights obligations on any or all parties anywhere in the world. - (CS) Mr President, 30 seconds will be enough for me.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission regularly monitors the development of the situation in Iraq, particularly in relation to Camp Ashraf.
