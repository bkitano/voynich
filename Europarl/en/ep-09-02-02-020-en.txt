Non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity (short presentation) - The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Záborská, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity.
The EU cohesion policy, through the European Social Fund, will continue to cofinance initiatives at national and local level.
We are applying Rule 45 which, in fact, provides a very strict framework for our speaking time, since only the rapporteur can take the floor.
