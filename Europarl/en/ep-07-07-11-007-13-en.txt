That text will be inserted elsewhere, in the form of Amendments 20 and 21.
Voting against the deletion of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 means that if a vote is held on Amendments 20 and 21, we will simply be covering the same ground.
For this reason I would ask this House that now we vote against, and then vote in favour of Amendments 20 and 21, which means that the text itself will remain the same, but it will only be moved to a more suitable place in the report. - Before the vote on Amendment 37 (FR) Mr President, please could you tell the French booth that we are talking about paragraphs, not recitals.
That is very good. - Before the vote on Amendment 21 , rapporteur - (PL) Mr President, may I point out that as a result of the vote on paragraph 3, which was not deleted, and Amendment 20, which we adopted, in the report we now have two paragraphs which say the same thing.
