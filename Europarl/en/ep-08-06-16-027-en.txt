Policy coherence for development and the effects of the EU's exploitation of certain biological natural resources on development in West Africa (debate) The next and last item is the debate on the report by Frithjof Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on policy coherence for development and the effects of the EU's exploitation of certain biological natural resources on development in West Africa (INI/2007/2183).
An additional EUR 60 million will be earmarked up to 2010 to finance the Global Alliance against Climate Change, an initiative we launched last year to underpin the efforts of the poorest countries to adapt to climate change.
In relation to fisheries policy, as you rightly emphasised, the new fisheries partnership agreements have brought about greater coherence between the common fisheries policy and development policy; these new agreements are no longer confined to offering fishing opportunities to Community vessels, but also make it possible to embark on a dialogue with other partners in order to help them introduce a real sustainable and responsible fisheries policy in their waters.
The analysis of the exploitation of natural resources in West Africa by the European Union provides a real, rather than a half-hearted, assessment of the role of the European Union in this African region.
Fisheries in West African waters are close to being exhausted, trade in illegal timber is destroying the environment, and the exploitation of other natural resources has proved to have huge consequences in a poor and politically unstable region.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, the first thing I wish to do - and this may come as a surprise in the light of her intervention - is to express my thanks to Mrs Fraga Est√©vez, for we personally cooperated very constructively on the report and resolved numerous problems too.
It is a problem, but I would nevertheless like to thank you for our good personal cooperation on the substance of the report.
