A new framework strategy for multilingualism (vote) - Before the vote on paragraph 20: (ES) Mr President, in the event of paragraph 20 not being rejected, I propose an oral amendment: 'Otherwise, lesser-used languages and less-recognised languages, particularly in Western Europe, of the new Member States, will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages, especially English.' (Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
