The impact of the civil war between 1975 and 1990, the 2006 summer crisis with Israel, chronic political instability and an economic policy set adrift have caused a serious economic, financial and social crisis.
It transpires that funds in connection with the adoption in January 2007 of the EU-Lebanon Action Plan as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy will not be available until 2009.
The MFA will consist of a donation of 30 million euros and a loan of 50 million euros to help the Lebanese Government take on post-war reconstruction and continue its economic revival.
It must have a regular legal basis and cannot be based on ad hoc Council decisions for each operation.
In such a situation, it is right that we should be prepared to provide macro-financial assistance to assist in that recovery.
The money from that policy will not be available until 2009 or 2010, but when that funding does become available I look forward to the EU assisting in the social and economic reforms in Lebanon.
The latter is in the midst of the most serious economic and political crisis to befall it since the end of the war in 1990.
I should therefore also like to thank the rapporteur for so skilfully endeavouring to involve Parliament in the decision-making process regarding assistance to Lebanon.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 November 2007.
