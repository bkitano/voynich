The amendment is as follows: in annex 1 the new figure for item B 'Neighbourhood and Partnership Countries' should read 13 664 000 000, with the figure for the sub-ceiling for 'Mediterranean countries' 9 700 000 000.
The correct figure for the 'maximum ceiling' is now 29 567 000 000 and the correct 'General Mandate' figure is 27 567 000 000.
