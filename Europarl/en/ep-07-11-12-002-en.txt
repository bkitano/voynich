On 3 and 4 December 1997, 122 states signed this historic treaty in Ottawa.
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 to acknowledge this achievement.
Despite these successes, there are more than 69 countries that have not yet abolished landmines.
From 1997 to 2004, the European Union invested more than a billion euros in the battle against landmines.
