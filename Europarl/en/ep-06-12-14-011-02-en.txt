Implication of the UN forces in sexual abuses in Liberia and in Haiti The next item on the agenda is the debate on the implication of the UN forces in sexual abuses in Liberia and in Haiti.
author. - (ES) Mr President, why are we talking about the United Nations?
author. - (PT) It has been well documented that there have been complaints of children being subject to rape and forced into prostitution by UN peacekeeping forces in Haiti and Liberia.
This follows on from other similar scandals, including paedophilia perpetrated by UN personnel in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the trafficking of human beings in Kosovo.
While we are condemning this behaviour, therefore, we are also acknowledging that they are exceptional cases and expressing our satisfaction at the fact that it has been the UN itself that has brought them to light.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the references to the sexual abuse of children in Haiti and Liberia by UN personnel is just the most recent in a long list of similar scandals.
