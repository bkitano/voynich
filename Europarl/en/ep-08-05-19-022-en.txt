rapporteur. - (SV) Ladies and gentlemen, first a big thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs for their close cooperation.
Amendments 20 and 21 are particularly important.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that you have made yourself available today, Mr Potoƒçnik.
We must do everything possible, not only in multilateral negotiations but also in our bilateral negotiations, to safeguard genuine open access to markets in raw materials.
We have no transparency regarding the trade in such materials engaged in by China and certain other countries.
The new crisis threatens to kill more in a day than have died from terrorism in the six years since 9/11.
Zbigniew Zaleski, I agree that trade must not amount to a kind of neocolonial theft of raw materials from developing countries.
I therefore call on Zbigniew Zaleski and everyone else to be sure to back Amendments 20 and 21.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 20 May 2008.
