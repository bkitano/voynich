(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year, 13 January marks the 20th anniversary of an event which brought down the walls of the Soviet empire.
The bloody events of the night of 13 January stunned Europe and the whole world.
On behalf of all the people of Lithuania, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the resolution adopted on 24 January 1991, supporting the Baltic States, and condemning Soviet aggression.
Thank you, Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė.
