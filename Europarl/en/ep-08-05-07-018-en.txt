Support schemes for farmers (support for cotton) (debate) The next item is the report by Ioannis Gklavakis, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, as regards the support scheme for cotton - C6-0447/2007 -.
In 2006, as you know, the Court of Justice annulled the cotton reform that we agreed in 2004, ruling that it was in breach of the proportionality principle.
There are four cotton-growing countries in the EU: Greece, Spain, Bulgaria and, on a very small scale, Portugal.
Allow me to mention briefly the 2004 proposal to support cotton.
Then in subsequent years cotton-growing went into decline, and there was eventually a 50% decrease in Spain and one of about 20% in Greece.
Cotton farms in Spain shrunk by 25% and in Greece by 11%.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to join in what I think are deserved congratulations for the rapporteur and thank him for his availability and cooperation at all times, especially in terms of meeting with all the producers in my region, Andalusia, as he did.
We disagree with reducing the quota in Greece in order to increase the coupled aid per hectare.
The truth is that Spain is a highly successful industrial country with a labour force of around 20 million people.
Unfortunately, the report we are discussing today has come about due to pressure from the European Court of Justice's ruling rather than to a political wish to ensure a long-term and stable scheme in the cotton sector until 2013 or to bring about a reform respecting the terms and rules of the WTO and CAP.
It is difficult to accept that eligible land in Greece will be reduced to 270 000 hectares from last year's 340 000 hectares under cultivation.
Thus in the case of Greece we have moved from 370 000 hectares at a subsidy of EUR 594 per hectare, to 270 000 hectares at EUR 750; but if we cultivate more than 270 000 hectares, opting for 370 000 hectares, which we are perfectly entitled to do, no one will come and tell us, as they used to, that there is an upper ceiling or a penalty.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
