It has long been the wish of Members of the European Parliament, their desire but one might also say their demand, that Euronews, which is funded - at least in part - by EU money, should broadcast programmes in each Member State's official language.
This political agreement entitled 'Communicating Europe in Partnership' was signed on 22 October 2008.
Once they are all up and running, these networks, together with Euronews, will reach between 60 and 90 million citizens each week in all the languages of the European Union.
The presentation is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 24 March 2009.
Active dialogue with civil society is the most important way to bolster the Union's legitimacy.
