European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) (debate) The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Giles Chichester and Angelika Niebler, on the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - B6-0159/2008).
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the honourable Members will know that in accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the ENISA Agency, the mandate of ENISA automatically expires on 13 March 2009.
It is true that the evaluation of ENISA launched by the Commission in 2006 identified a number of problems, but it also identified positive aspects of the Agency's achievement in the light of the limited means at its disposal.
It should transform the body from a temporary foundation into a permanent one; above all, this must be accompanied by a simultaneous increase in staff and an updating of the extremely important Articles 2 and 3 in its Rules of Procedure.
I must remind you, however, that the evaluation report in 2007 was able to evaluate ENISA only in its first year of operation; as a result, the evaluation is no longer reliable or, of course, timely.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in conclusion I would like to say that there is unanimous support in the Council, and broad support in the European Parliament, for extending the duration of ENISA for three years.
