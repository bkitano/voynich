Technical requirements and administrative procedures for commercial transportation by aeroplane (EU OPS)/use of child-restraint safety devices (OPS 1.730) (debate) The next item is the oral question - B6-0169/2008) by Eva Lichtenberger, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to the Commission, on technical requirements and administrative procedures for commercial transportation by aeroplane (EU OPS)/use of child-restraint safety devices (OPS 1.730).
We need to do so. (Applause) Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, Mrs Lichtenberger, I shall reply to you in Italian because I know that you are a scholar of my mother tongue.
That is why, faced with a set of contradictory and incomplete information, the Agency launched a study in 2007 to obtain a more reliable scientific response on this matter.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, we all agree that we need to improve child protection during flights.
We must, therefore, also answer the question - assuming we are willing to equip planes for the safety of children - of who will pay for that safety protection.
Where children up to the age of 14 can travel by train for free, it is also the other passengers who contribute to that cost.
I repeat: I regard the safety of every citizens as a priority, especially that of our weakest citizens, which is why I shall endeavour to ensure that specific safety protection measures are adopted as rapidly as possible in keeping with the legislative timetable.
