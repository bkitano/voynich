President Barroso and I were among the first to congratulate President Ouattara on his victory.
On 3 December the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly was equally unambiguous in its declaration.
African bodies have already resorted to sanctions on Côte d'Ivoire.
Laurent Gbagbo must accept defeat.
I should like to thank you in advance, High Representative, for bearing these messages, especially this evening.
As First Vice-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would also like to point out that a declaration was adopted by our Assembly on 3 December in Kinshasa firmly condemning the decision of the Ivorian Constitutional Council for invalidating the results.
The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is therefore very dangerous, since we are all well aware that the country, which bears the marks of years of conflict and violence, is particularly prone to steps that may lead to a repeat of the civil war which broke out in 2002 after a violent coup.
