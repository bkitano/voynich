Competition Policy 2005 (debate) The next item is the report by Mrs E.
I am very pleased that Parliament supports the Commission's efforts to modernise competition policy, and in particular the work we did in 2005 to pursue a more refined economic approach.
We in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are also concerned about the conclusions that are going to be drawn from the sectoral surveys that you have been carrying out, and specifically in connection with the potential impact on the structure of this or that segment of the market.
Paragraph 13 supports a common consolidated corporate tax base, which is another step towards a compulsory EU-wide corporation tax, which is fundamentally anti-competitive.
That means involving all the stakeholders - Parliament as well as the outside world - and taking into account the point touched upon by Sophia in 't Veld.
I now come to the point that Sophia in 't Veld touched upon.
Turning to state aid issues, in particular in reply to Sophia in 't Veld, state aid is in principle, as we are all aware, banned by the Treaty to avoid distortions of competition in our single market.
But Sophia in 't Veld is right: we need to do more to evaluate the effects of state aid, whether it makes sense and how.
We have taken the Member State concerned to Court for not respecting our two Article 21 decisions under the Merger Regulation.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 19 June 2007.
