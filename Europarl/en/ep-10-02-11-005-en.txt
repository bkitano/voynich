Dear colleagues, today marks the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release from prison in South Africa after serving 27 years of a life sentence imposed by the regime in 1984. (Applause) As you perhaps know, Mr Mandela was the first winner of the Sakharov Prize when Parliament instituted this prize in 1988.
As you rightly said, 20 years ago Nelson Mandela was released from prison after serving 27 years of political imprisonment.
