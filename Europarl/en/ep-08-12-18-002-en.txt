The duties of information, and both directives to this effect, which are 25 and 30 years old and have been amended many times, are now being cleaned up and simplified in what is known as a fast-track procedure.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs van den Burg, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is today going to give its verdict on a proposal for simplification.
Accounting is also a very useful element in business-to-business lending.
This is why I, like Mr Gauz√®s, very strongly support the resolution proposed by Mrs van den Burg and adopted by our committee, a resolution that is about asking the Commission to submit a proposal that would enable the Member States to exempt businesses that are characterised by their very small size - a balance sheet of less than EUR 500 000, a turnover of less than EUR 1 million and a staff complement of less than 10 people - and that have only local or regional operations in a single Member State, from having to comply with the directive.
That is what I wished to say; I believe that this debate will enlighten my colleague, Mr McCreevy, who is responsible for the internal market, and that this will enable us to work on this reduction of the administrative burden that places a strain on businesses, especially the smallest ones.
rapporteur. - (NL) The message from this Parliament was, to my mind, loud and clear.
The vote will take place on Thursday 18 December 2008.
