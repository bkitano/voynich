This change is made as an oral amendment, so if there is someone who objects to this, I can understand that, but we have agreed between the groups that Amendment 4 should also be accepted and should be voted on.
As the House has voted on Amendment 2 by Mrs Kauppi, by definition Amendment 4 falls. (FR) I am pleased to see that the chairwoman of the committee responsible agrees with the analysis of the sittings services.
