2007 discharge: EU general budget - Council (debate) The next item is the second report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2007, Section II - Council (C6-0417/2008 - - Committee on Budgetary Control.
Rapporteur: Søren Bo Søndergaard Thank you, Mr President.
What was new was that in April, Parliament put a stop to it.
I believe that this was the question that resulted in a large majority of Members of this House refusing to grant discharge for the Council's budget.
On 24 September, a meeting was held between the Council and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the committee's rapporteurs and the coordinators.
I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency once again.
I also want to acknowledge good progress made with the common agricultural policy and, in particular, the IAC system, which has given great benefit as well.
I agree, and in this respect, 2007 was no different from previous years.
In April 2009, the Budgetary Control Committee decided to postpone discharge to the Council.
The first was that the Council refused to accept any kind of official, formal meeting with Parliament.
I therefore ask the House to support the motion. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, first of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency of the Council is present, and I would also like to personally thank Mrs Malmström for having made the procedure more transparent.
It is money that belongs to our citizens, and they must have a right to know what it is being spent on.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Kallas, who has done such excellent work in the last five years.
Our task today is to decide whether we have moved a step closer or whether we are still in the same situation.
I therefore believe it is right to defend what we have achieved by voting in favour, thereby continuing this struggle - which is, after all, what it is.
