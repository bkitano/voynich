Between 2008 and 2013, the joint undertaking will take charge of the development phase with a budget of EUR 300 million per year divided between three partners - the Commission, Eurocontrol and a consortium of private businesses.
Then comes the deployment phase, which will be taken charge of by the industry and which is predicted to last from 2014 to 2020.
The SESAR project should be driven by industry, not by bureaucrats.
I agree that there is a need to develop a new generation of European air traffic system so that we might guarantee safe and smoothly flowing air traffic in Europe over the next 20 years.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if it is used properly and enters into effect as soon as possible, SESAR will be able to make an important contribution to reducing the gases that are detrimental to climate.
I should therefore recommend that the determining factor be defined in the charter of the joint undertaking as an aircraft standby weight of 600 kg.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.
Mr President, the European Union had to develop this system of air traffic control, bringing together the 40 different networks currently in place in the EU, as a result of the projected increase in the volume of air traffic.
This legal basis is Article 171 of the Treaty, as Mr Fernandez has just said, and this has been confirmed by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and by the Commission.
The debate is closed.
