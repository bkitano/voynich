I believe - I may be wrong - that I first put Amendment 1 to the vote by roll-call vote and that I then put to the vote ... (Objections) OK, I will trust the House.
My guess is, if my recollection is correct, that Amendment 1 will be rejected and then the original text will be adopted, but I will do it.
The vote is open. (Amendment 1 was adopted by roll-call vote)
