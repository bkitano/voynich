Statements by the President Ladies and gentlemen, we have learned with deep sorrow of the death of our former colleague, Nicholas Bethell, who was a Member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1994 and again from 1999 to 2003.
Armed with his masterly knowledge of the Russian language and at considerable personal risk, Lord Bethell visited the Soviet Union on several occasions, where he made friends with many leading dissidents, such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, Anatoly Shcharansky and Alexander Ginsburg.
Lord Bethell translated two books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn into English.
He brought Anatoly Shcharansky and Elena Bonner, Sakharov's widow, to the European Parliament, not just once but on several occasions.
