Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose.
Nevertheless, we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico.
Before the vote on Amendment 10: Mr President, Amendment 10 by the Greens is not in conflict with Amendment 1.
on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. - (DE) I am on Mrs Hassi's side.
