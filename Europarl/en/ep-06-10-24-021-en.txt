Third-country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action (debate) The next item is the report by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the annual report from the Commission to the European Parliament on third country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action against the Community (2004).
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 2004 annual report on third-country anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action, presented by the Commission services, has uncovered a piece of information that has raised a number of concerns within our parliamentary committee.
The European Union is a major exporter worldwide and this leaves us exposed to trade defence actions by third countries.
We need greater transparency in the operation of trade defence instruments.
However, to have any moral authority in this area, our own anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations must be transparent and impartial.
Import quotas, anti-dumping duties and administrative obstacles for agricultural products cost every European household approximately USD 1 500 a year.
It is therefore very important for trade policy to be stable and predictable.
I see them beginning to wonder whether sheltering from the global economy would be better; whether erecting barriers between us and our trading partners might not be a better way of securing our jobs and our livelihoods.
