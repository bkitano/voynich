At this moment in time, nothing else could justify major legislative initiatives on this matter. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would actually have liked to support Mrs Rühle's report, because it contains a great many very positive elements.
Romania implemented the online public procurement system back in 2002, which led to a reduction in public expenditure, a greater degree of transparency and an increase in access to the public procurement market for SMEs. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this sterling report.
The vote will take place tomorrow (Tuesday, 18 May 2010).
