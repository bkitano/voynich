Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Gottardi report and the substance of the report fits well with that of the two earlier Commission reports on public finances in the EMU released in June 2007 and 2008.
The Commission also agrees with the three latest amendments tabled by the rapporteur on 7 January.
The overall economic prospects for 2010 are also discouraging, so the Commission agrees with the European Parliament that supporting demand by making use of discretionary fiscal policy measures is now essential.
This achievement has been possible thanks to the presence of favourable economic conditions in 2006 and 2007.
