Asset management II (debate) The next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Asset Management ΙΙ.
Secondly, not only retail investors but also professional providers and institutional investors should be able to benefit fully from a single European market.
A European private placement regime can remedy that situation.
Parliament's previous report on asset management was also an excellent contribution to our work on the UCITS Directive.
UCITS 3 already permits a wide range of innovative strategies, including some types of alternative investment.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, in relation to this important own-initiative report on the Commission White Paper on investment funds, our position is that we have decided by general agreement to focus on the non-legislative aspects, given that the legislative proposal for revision of the UCITS III Directive will be tabled in early 2008.
The sector is impatiently awaiting revision of the UCITS Directive.
Of course, private investors should have more rights, but these should be defined separately.
I acknowledge that training really is very important, but alongside it we must highlight tax matters.
It cannot be that if I want to take out UCITS in another country, I will end up in a worse situation than if I did it in my own country.
I also see merit in proposals to enhance the EU private placement regime and agree that the definition of eligible investors is crucial.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
