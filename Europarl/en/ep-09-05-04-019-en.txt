I must point out that the 2002 directive made provision for self-employed drivers to be included as of 23 March 2009.
Therefore, to include self-employed drivers in a directive on working time would be to misunderstand the concept of self-employment, because when someone is self-employed, they set their own working time.
Madam President, honourable Members, you know that road safety is one of the priorities of my work as Commissioner for Transport.
This is something we must look at very carefully, because there are no precedents in European law establishing how long a self-employed person can work for in an office or laboratory.
The problem was not resolved, however, and following a conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council, the Commission was invited to weigh up the pros and cons of extending working time rules to self-employed workers and thus present a proposal in 2008.
The Commission met this request, publishing a detailed study in 2007 that came to the following conclusions.
Secondly, there are no precedents in Community social legislation governing the work of the self-employed.
Lastly, it is very important to point out that the application of working time rules to self-employed drivers is ineffectual and very difficult to achieve, since these drivers do not have to record their working time for salary purposes, not to mention the fact that the administrative costs of applying such rules would be very high.
There is no evidence of a correlation between road safety and exempting self-employed drivers from the rules on working time; in fact, the reverse is true.
The current situation is alarming.
I thank all my fellow Members for their views and I would point out that this is precisely the dialogue that we want to leave open by voting against Amendment 54 rejecting the Commission's proposal.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 5 May 2009.
