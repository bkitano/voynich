Nonetheless, the overall responsibility for this process lies with the Commission.
I would therefore like to address you quite directly, Commissioner Šemeta.
However, the discussions that we had were very intense, Commissioner Šemeta.
The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, spent over an hour negotiating with us on the details.
However, I also think that we need to utilise this momentum that we have created together, Commissioner Šemeta - and I would ask you to pass on our thanks to President Barroso - and this dynamism for the other discharge reports.
I am pleased to have Mr Fjellner, the forthcoming rapporteur on the budget discharge, at my side.
I hope that he will continue the work with the same impetus.
The Commission has begun - and this is crucial, because we are after all talking about 80% shared responsibility here - quite clearly to state erroneous expenditure in the accounts of the European Union for 2009.
Building on this new transparency, therefore, we have set five key requirements.
It is important that you have drawn up guidelines - we are grateful to you for that - that you have shown which countries have actually provided national management declarations - it is not many: basically, only the Netherlands meets the requirements in full - and that you have instructed the Directorates General to show for the first time in the activity report for 2010 what components will be present in a future national administrative declaration, even if this will only take place at working level.
I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas.
I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, as there was a clear majority on the Committee who were in favour of the report and the atmosphere was very positive indeed.
My thanks also go to all the officials who were of assistance to us.
Of course, this is problematic, because we all have our own pet projects and our own ideas about what Parliament should be doing anyway.
The EU's economy will not rise or fall because of them, but the loss of reputation that we could cause if we do not function in a reasonable manner and one that is acceptable in the eyes of the public is considerable, and that is why we really need to think carefully about what we are going to do.
Information technology must be delivered and all the rest, but with regard to everything that goes any further than that, we have to be very critical, to ensure that it is actually connected with the work that we are here to do.
Now that time is short, I wish to raise two important but perhaps equally troublesome issues in this report.
The next important matter is that I cannot possibly justify to the public the fact that every three weeks we change our place of work.
This would suit me fine, because the main issue is that we should only have one place of work and not spend money on constant travel to and fro.
Procedures must be improved, but I would also like to take this opportunity to call on all the Members of the European Parliament to understand that a certain level of discipline is required of us.
Please believe me when I say that there are only two options; either these checks continue, which will mean that we can feel safer, or we dispense with them, in which case there can be no question of safety.
I would therefore ask the assistants, who work very hard in Parliament, also to understand the need for these checks.
The discharge of the European Council is always complicated because a debate develops each year between the two institutions, the European Parliament and the European Council concerning the discharge procedure.
Therefore I congratulate those involved in the work of the Hungarian Presidency.
We consider it to be a positive result that the Council has acknowledged the discharge procedure and the budgetary procedure as two different processes that must be handled separately.
Ladies and gentlemen, as substitute for Mr Rivellini I can say that as regards the seven proposals we should motion for a resolution by Parliament as laid down in the proposal.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you deserve a pat on the back.
Ladies and gentlemen, EUR 22.6 billion, that is how much the 10th European Development Fund will spend in the 2008-2013 period.
I would like to make five comments.
We all recognise that budget aid can be an important element for the improvement of development cooperation.
We are also entrusting a few tasks to the European Investment Bank and the European Commission.
I would also like to very much thank Mr O'Shea from the Court of Auditors for his contribution and cooperation.
At the same time, our role as a Parliament is accountability towards citizens, so we have to make sure that taxpayers' money is used properly, transparently and effectively.
Let me now turn to the two agencies for which our committee is proposing to postpone the discharge: CEPOL and EMEA.
In CEPOL we were expecting to find problems dating back to last year's report.
The report identifies many examples of good practice and includes proposals for future improvements.
The next speaker is Minister Zsolt László Becsey on behalf of the Council.
I am saying what our colleague Bart Staes said a few minutes ago: it is very good that you are present.
Secondly, I would like to ask Mr President to allow me the two minutes at the end of the debate regardless of when my machine is switched off.
I therefore welcome the opportunity to present the views of the Council and the Hungarian Presidency during this debate.
We are ready to share our ideas with you.
The 2009 discharge procedure is now reaching its end.
It was an intensive period in which Parliament and Commission gave shape to the special partnership between our two institutions.
I am happy to see that this approach is high on the agenda of the ongoing discussions and the proposals which are on the table really match the Commission's ambitions.
It is now our common responsibility, together with the Council, to translate concretely those lessons into a new set of modern and efficient rules and processes which will enable the Union to meet better the expectations of our 500 million citizens in a sound and cost-effective way.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (HU) Madam President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I would like to draw the attention of the Committee on Budgetary Control to several proposals, and ask it to include them in its report.
This rate decreased from 54% in 2007 to 36%.
There were minor problems with the agencies, I do not have time to elaborate on it, but in general we must say that their financial management is acceptable and should be supported.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Madam President, unlike the previous committee, the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not able to express a purely positive opinion.
We nonetheless welcomed the fact that substantial resources were provided for the trans-European transport networks and that in 2009 the Galileo programme finally had a very good year, which was regrettably not the case in previous years.
We were also able to state that the coordinators are doing a good job in the case of the trans-European networks, because they are also making a great contribution to the overall financing of these major projects.
Finally, I would like to mention that we would like to see greater coordination between transport and cohesion policy.
In general terms, I should like to make two brief political observations, namely the lack of any multiannual programming - which is symptomatic of a leadership deficit - and the dearth of incisiveness in the work of some agencies, such as the European Railway Agency.
Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Šemeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget.
Five percent of payments from the European Regional Fund still have errors and must therefore be described as irregular payments.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - Madam President, the Community Fisheries Control Agency was established in 2005 to ensure better compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy by the EU Member States.
This agency, which is based in Vigo, Spain, plays an important role in strengthening fisheries control and ensuring coordination between EU Member States.
I believe that the multiannual work programme will improve cost-effectiveness through enhanced regional cooperation and the pooling of means under joint deployment plans.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (ES) Madam President, year after year we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality have been reiterating the need for a gender perspective to be incorporated into all stages of budgetary procedure, in order to make progress with policies on equality and, therefore, on equality between men and women in the European Union.
This is a sound report and I can only say that we are essentially in agreement in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the recommendations that we have tabled.
The Commission must therefore put pressure on the Member States to persuade them to assume responsibility for the funds that the EU allows them to manage.
The Commission must provide these countries with support, but it must also use them as an example in order to force other countries to do the same thing.
I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis.
National management declarations should help us a great deal to see how EU money is used by national authorities and who is responsible for the use of this money.
The second reason is that we are on the eve of the adoption of a new multiannual budget.
I believe this must be the first time that we have worked together in such a constructive spirit; not only Commissioner Šemeta, but also individual commissioners in charge of their own remits have really invested time on this discharge.
They have met both the shadow rapporteurs and the lead rapporteur on several occasions and, thanks to their constructive dialogue, I think that we have achieved a great deal.
President-in-Office of the Council, we must finally have this political responsibility for shared management of EU funds in place.
And yet, if we add everything up, we are going to spend more or less EUR 136 million on the Museum of European History.
Our demand is very simple, President-in-Office: as Parliament, as the body approving the discharge, we want access to all documents.
Its procurement procedures for several projects have been fraught with errors, which corresponds to the significant amount of EUR 30 million.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DA) Thank you, Madam President.
No, we are not being overly critical.
I repeat, in the strongest possible terms, that it is nothing short of madness to sign off EUR 523 million of - let us remember - taxpayers' money, while the official auditing arm of the EU is investigating possible fraud and financial mismanagement at these agencies.
