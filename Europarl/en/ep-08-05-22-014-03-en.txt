author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, initially, we did not wish Parliament to consider right now the situation in Burundi, for, as you know, the Burundian authorities are currently negotiating with the FNL, the National Liberation Forces; they have reached a critical stage which is finally presenting a positive outlook and which should, we hope, lead to the practical implementation of the agreements entered into in Dar es Salaam that aim to put an end to the fighting, violence and insecurity affecting the country.
Therefore, in agreement with the other political groups, we wanted to make this resolution into a call for positive action with regard to this associated country situated in the troubled Great Lakes Region.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, in my mind's eye I see a beautiful country.
We call on both sides to respect the ceasefire of 7 September last year and particularly demand that the leader of the FNL, Agathon Rwasa, should fully engage in the peace process.
The European Commission is therefore delighted that, on 16 May 2008, a delegation from the Palipehutu-FNL - that is, the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People-National Liberation Forces - returned to Bujumbura, and I hope that it will be possible for both sides to resume active talks.
