Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work (vote) - Report: Scheele In view of the length of the forthcoming vote on the report by Peter Liese and the need to hold the formal sitting at 12 noon, I propose, ladies and gentlemen, that we bring forward the votes on the reports by Romana Jordan Cizelj, PÃ¡l Schmitt and Vittorio Prodi, and put Mr Liese's report to the vote after the formal sitting. (Parliament approved the proposal)
