They are used today in the treatment of more than 80 diseases, and especially of cancers - brain cancer, blood cancer, leukaemia, lymphoma - anaemia, autoimmune diseases, certain rare diseases, and the list keeps on growing.
We therefore call on the Commission to launch, in conjunction, of course, with the 27 Member States - as the Commissioner mentioned - an information campaign aimed at parents-to-be, so that these donations become a reality, if not a necessity.
That is why I, and why we, think it is crucial, over and above the uniform transposition of this 2004 directive on the quality and safety of tissues and cells, which has already been mentioned, and which is the subject of our second question, that Europe strongly encourages the Member States to simplify their maternity hospital accreditation procedures and systems.
We can no longer allow the passionate debate - which we are not here to resolve - and controversy surrounding the purpose and use of this blood - whether it ends up in public or private blood banks - to actually stop us from talking about this technique, and this is the appeal launched by Professor Eliane Gluckman, who has dedicated her entire career to making the donation of cord blood a donation of life.
However, we also know that their potential for treating illnesses may be endless - illnesses such as those that have already been mentioned: cancer, Alzheimer's and rare diseases.
It has been said that this research has the potential to help deal with 70 to 80 diseases.
Through the collection of cord blood at birth, which, in the past, used to be discarded with the placenta, we can obtain a significant source of undifferentiated stem cells without causing discomfort to the mother or child, and these can be modulated and used successfully at any time in the future to treat leukaemia and at least 70 other conditions.
As well as that, we already have a system in place within the existing national blood banks that can regulate and control the quality of that supply.
However, several Member States have established public cord blood banks based on altruistic and voluntary cord blood donation.
