We know that around 20% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transport.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for tabling this question.
However, when Mrs McAvan tabled her question, I had the feeling that she would have preferred to have stopped production in this energy sector.
After all, Europe and Canada have such strong economic links that Canadian industry, whether it wants to or not, must adapt to European environmental protection requirements in order to operate on the European market, for example in this area. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for taking the initiative in this case and Mrs Hedegaard for addressing the problem.
Having listened to what Mrs Hedegaard said, I assume that will happen, but I hope that she will also more vehemently oppose the exploitation of the tar sands in Canada and in other parts of the world. (RO) Mr President, significant results can be achieved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 if investments are made in measures for increasing energy efficiency in buildings and the transport sector.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Parliament for the very clear message it has given here tonight.
Let me finish by saying that, when it comes to this default value for tar sands the overall delay in the implementation of the directive means that we could get the default value included now in the same sort of round as when we are implementing the directive as such.
