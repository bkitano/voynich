There is an amendment which has been proposed by Mr Trakatellis, Mr Varvitsiotis, Mr Papastamkos, Mr Lambrinidis and other Members regarding one particular week in the year 2009, namely week 16, from 13 to 19 April.
However, this does not imply a preliminary decision concerning the proposed part-session from 20 to 23 April. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and this includes interreligious dialogue.
Week 17, the plenary week in April 2009, will commence on 21 April and end on 24 April - I do not wish to say any more than that - to allow the Members concerned to celebrate the Orthodox Easter.
That being the case, Members from some countries have concerns because, if you look closely, it is clear that, if the constituent sitting takes place on 14 July 2009, some Members will not achieve the requisite five years for pension rights.
The constituent sitting is being held on 14 July.
This is one of the most important secular holidays.
