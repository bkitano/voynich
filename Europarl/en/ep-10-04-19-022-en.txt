In my assessment, which is supported by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the vast majority of the five year plan adopted by Parliament in 2006 - for which Mrs Jeggle was rapporteur - has been implemented fairly reasonably.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, Mrs Paulsen, for the own-initiative report on the EU Animal Welfare Action Plan.
I note the call for a new action plan for 2011-15, and am pleased to inform you that the Commission has already started work in that direction.
As mentioned in the report, Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union underlines the need for consideration for all animals.
The Commission plans to present a new EU strategy for animal welfare in 2011.
