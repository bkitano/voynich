This is a report that will help as much as possible to provide more stability and we must ensure as far as possible that all the countries are harmonised with regard to the applicable rates to reduce discrepancies as much as possible.
Today is the last day that my fellow Member from Malta will attend this plenary and I think that I too would like to wish him well in his work in the coming years.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the UEN Group in this debate, I should like to draw attention to three issues.
Firstly, the European Commission's proposals on changes to VAT on financial and insurance services improve legal certainty not only for economic entities providing these services but also for fiscal entities in the individual Member States.
The impact of these changes on the cost of financial and insurance services for consumers should also be studied. (MT) The rapporteur has upheld the framework of the Commission's proposal so that we are confronted with the problem that we have been putting off for more than 30 years.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 September 2008.
