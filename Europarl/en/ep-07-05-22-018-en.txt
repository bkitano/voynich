The Samara summit took place at a critical time in EU-Russia relations.
The detention of Garry Kasparov at Moscow airport, preventing him from attending a demonstration in Samara to coincide with the summit, was particularly regrettable and was very clearly addressed.
Thirdly, both the EU and Russia recognise that our economic and trading links in particular are larger and more intense than ever.
As the motion for a resolution on Estonia states, attacks targeted at one of the smallest Member States are considered a test case for the solidarity of the EU as a whole, and all the major political groups have agreed on the text of the joint motion for a resolution on Estonia.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to make two preliminary observations.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to touch on two topics in recent Estonian-Russian relations, firstly the cyber war and secondly the disinformation that has been engaged in by President Putin.
At approximately midnight on 27 April, the police found Dmitri, who had suffered a stab wound, and called an ambulance for him at 12.26 a.m.
It was our moral duty to show solidarity with Estonia, but such solidarity is also in our best political interests.
The European Union should understand that during the 50 years of Soviet occupation the Communist regime committed multiple crimes against the populations of the Baltic States.
The debate in the European Parliament during the last part-session in Brussels and the approval of the resolution expressing solidarity with the Estonian Government is a conscious policy to support the rewriting of history and the revival of fascism in the Baltic and other states.
That is important for the whole of the European Union.
We emphasised again and again that we are working as an EU of 27 Member States and that solidarity will be maintained.
The vote will take place on Thursday 24 May.
