The change means that now only Article 95 on the internal market, and thus only economic interests, are included as a legal base and not Article 152 on public health, in which the patient is taken as the starting point.
We will therefore vote on 80 amendments from the appropriate committee, and we are aware that Mr Bushill-Matthews wishes to table an oral amendment to Amendment 100. - Before the vote on Amendment 100: rapporteur. - Mr President, apologies to colleagues for introducing it at this late stage, but the reason is one of simple clarification.
So far, in voting on this report, we have voted on a series of amendments affecting Articles 15, 16 and 17.
The adopted amendments affecting those articles are the following: 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110 and 135.
We must decide on the admissibility of Amendments 159, 119, 116, 125 and 126.1, in order to ensure that the final text adopted by Parliament corresponds with the legal base.
