rapporteur. - Madam President, this report closes a certain phase in our EU-Ukraine policies.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) Although the present turbulent domestic politics in Ukraine have weakened the country's negotiating position, they must be seen as part of a democratic process.
These efforts have been carried out in especially demanding circumstances and this means we have an even greater responsibility towards that country and towards ourselves.
The involvement of foreign banks in the Ukrainian banking sector has already reached 35%.
The services sector is of fundamental and vital importance for the Ukrainian economy.
The European Union must be ready to support Ukraine's efforts but Ukraine must also do its share of domestic reforms.
