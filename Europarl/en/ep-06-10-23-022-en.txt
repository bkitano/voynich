rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, almost 12 months ago we first gave our approval to the European payment order, a new law to assist in simplified debt recovery for businesses and citizens owed money in another EU Member State.
Interim Justicia carried out a survey on payment practices in 16 European countries some 10 years ago.
Finally, since we started this process a year ago and since the Commission's original proposal, we now have a new institutional agreement, with effect from July 2006.
