Human rights in the world 2006 and the EU's policy on the matter (vote) - Coveney report - Before the vote on Amendment 19: Mr President, I wish to move an oral amendment to Amendment 19 so that the second half of the paragraph includes the words 'urges expansion of the temporary international mechanism and', with it then continuing 'urges the Council and the Commission to monitor changing circumstances closely', etc.
This oral amendment would therefore simply add some words from the original paragraph 28 to the text of Amendment 19.
