It seems certain that Mr Van Rompuy, the new President of the European Council, will not be joining us, and I regret that.
Indeed, he has been in office since 1 December 2009, he carries out an intense diplomatic role, and I believe that his first political act should have been to come and present himself to the European Parliament.
It was therefore up to him to come and present the conclusions of the European Council of 10 and 11 December 2009.
