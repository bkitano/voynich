Sakharov Prize 2009 (announcement of the winner) I would like to start with some important information about the Sakharov Prize for 2009.
This morning's Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2009 to Memorial, the organisation of Oleg Orlov, Sergey Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva and all other defenders of human rights in Russia whom it represents.
The purpose of this prize is for us Members of the European Parliament to express our great support for their activities. (Applause) I would like to make a couple of general points: since 1988, which is over 20 years ago now, the European Parliament inaugurated the annual Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought to honour persons or organisations for their contribution to the development of human rights and fundamental values.
It is not just the winner of the prize but also the nominees who deserve our great respect and deep recognition. (Applause) The prize giving ceremony will be on Wednesday, 16 December in Strasbourg.
