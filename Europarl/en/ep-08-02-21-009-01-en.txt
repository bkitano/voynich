East Timor The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution concerning East Timor.
The international community now has a responsibility to show its support for East Timor, to coordinate this support which it clearly failed to do in relation to the security system, and to resolve the basic issues of the structure of the East Timorese state.
It is this consensus that Ruy Cinatti referred to in his poem which is the most pressing need of East Timor.
However, the fact that on 11 February 2008 both the democratically elected President and the Prime Minister became victims of armed attempts on their lives is proof of how fragile a young democracy can be.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will support this resolution. - (NL) Mr President, some of my colleagues have already touched on the fact that it is no exaggeration to state that following the attacks on President Ramos Horta, East Timor is once again entering a critical phase.
After the attack on President Ramos Horta on 11 February of this year, East Timor experienced yet another political crisis.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission has condemned the attacks against President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao in the strongest terms.
The young democracy of East Timor is still extremely vulnerable in its political, judicial and security institutions.
The European Commission also decided to open a fully-fledged delegation in Dili, and the new head of delegation is expected to start work in March 2008.
In summary, the envisaged support under the Commission programme, more than EUR 80 million, is comprehensive and will help to address many of the present problems of the country.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
