Order of business The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 8 March 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated.
However, for now, I ask Parliament to agree that the oral question should be accompanied by the resolution, which did not come before us in January or February, but surely can now do so in March. (Applause) (Parliament rejected the motion.) Tuesday: Motion by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Virrankoski's report on biotechnology: Prospects and challenges for agriculture in Europe to be sent back to the committee. . - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the report held in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 24 January was split down the middle: of the 43 members present, 22 voted in favour, 15 voted against and 6 abstained.
Accordingly, I am in favour of it being referred back to the committee so that we might get the greatest possible support for it in plenary. (Parliament adopted the motion.) (MT) I ask that this debate on hunting in Malta be concluded without a resolution because I feel that such a resolution is unnecessary and unjustified, and for three reasons.
