Environmental protection from radiation following the crash of a military aircraft in Greenland (debate) The next item is the report by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the public health consequences of the 1968 Thule crash (petition 720/2002).
We are looking here at a very specific issue in the saga, namely the rights of the Thule workers under Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996, laying down the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.
The Commissioner offers his sympathy, but we do not need sympathy.
I want to seek to achieve a solution on behalf of the petitioners.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, this is a unique report on a unique petition and Mrs Wallis has dealt with it excellently.
The accident took place in 1968, while Denmark together with Greenland joined the European Union in 1973, and in 1985 Greenland left the European Union, while the Directive establishing basic safety standards in the event of such accidents (that is, Directive of the Council 96/29/EURATOM), dates from 13 May 1996.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Madam President, this is a grim state of affairs.
What happened involving the B-52 bomber is not the only nuclear activity that has polluted the Thule area.
I have no interest in defending the Danish Government on this matter.
That is why 18 years went by before the authorities began to take an interest in the health of the Greenlanders affected and of the civilian workers involved in the clean-up operation.
Mr Carswell has raised this matter in the Committee on Petitions.
The debate is closed.
