He was born on 29 October 1951 in Coimbra and was only 55 years old.
It is with great sadness that we learnt of the death of our former fellow Member Christian de la Malène, who was a Member of the European Parliament on two occasions - from 1959 to 1961 and from 1962 to 1994.
Christian de la Malène, who was also a former Minister and Senator under President De Gaulle, died on 26 September at the age of 86.
Christian de la Malène was a colleague and friend who will be remembered for his humanism and his political commitment.
