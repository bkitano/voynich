Mr President, I am presenting an own-initiative report on 'Better lawmaking 2006' pursuant to Article 9 of the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
The Impact Assessment Board that President Barroso put in place at the end of 2006 is having a real impact on the quality of our work.
