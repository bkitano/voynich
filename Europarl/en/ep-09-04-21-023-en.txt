The Commission adopted the proposal for a new Regulation on technical conservation measures for the Atlantic on 4 June of last year.
The proposal was drafted after extensive consultation of stakeholders and Member States during 2006 and 2007.
This new approach is not supported in your report, where Amendments 1, 6, 7, 25 and 26 call for Council regulations both for general and for detailed technical rules.
The Commission can partially accept Amendments 2 and 3, relating to additional illustrations of fishing gears, if needed, and to certain specific market provisions, particularly on the minimum size of species, with the aim of harmonising measures.
For that reason, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 4, 5, 21, 23 and 24.
However, I must express my reservations regarding Amendments 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 22.
Commissioner, during the debates we had in the Committee on Fisheries, it became apparent that the Commission defends this principle chiefly for reasons of control.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009.
