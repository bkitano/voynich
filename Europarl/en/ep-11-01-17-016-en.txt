EU-Cameroon forest law agreement - EU-Republic of Congo forest law agreement - FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements (continuation of debate) We now return to the debate.
Madam President, these Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) agreements that we are to vote on tomorrow concerning Congo and Cameroon are important European tools, or weapons, in the fight against illegal logging and, for that reason, I welcome them.
Madam President, the European Commission has initiated the process of concluding voluntary partnership agreements with countries which export timber to the European Union.
This is why it is so important to strengthen legal trade in timber.
We must also help in putting pressure on other importers, from outside Europe, to ensure the gradual elimination of illegal trade in timber.
We really do need to conclude FLEGT agreements with all countries with important tropical forests in either Asia or Latin America and with the major timber dealers, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, China and numerous other countries.
The question is: are we doing what we need to do?
A voluntary agreement is all well and good, but in this context, it will not get us anywhere.
That is where we come in with sustainable forest management: we are talking about Congo-Brazzaville (the Republic of the Congo) and Cameroon today, but we are also working with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and with Indonesia.
If we can use less timber, then other parts of the world will definitely learn from our example.
Then, as you said, Commissioner, Europe is a large market for tropical timber, but it is also - and this is essential for all exploiters and for all industry - a stable and lucrative market, and that is also a very important tool in these countries.
The vote will take place on Wednesday (19 January 2011).
in writing. - FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements were a good basis on which to build international cooperation to tackle the problem of deforestation.
