After the Conference of Presidents had considered the incidents in question, on the basis of Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure I invited a number of Members for discussions with a view to hearing their version of events before taking any decision on possible disciplinary action.
However, I consider that a distinction has to be made between conduct which is legitimate in the light of the Rules of Procedure and disruption of the kind which occurred on 12 December.
It is a core principle of parliamentarianism and democracy that, in exercising freedom of opinion, the freedom of others must also be respected - in this case the freedom of those who have been given the floor to speak in plenary.' Pursuant to Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure, the ten Members concerned were informed of the decision relating to them.
The following have forfeited their entitlement to the subsistence allowance: Jim Allister for 3 days, Godfrey Blum for 2 days, Sylwester Chruszcz for 2 days, Paul Marie Coûteaux for 5 days, Maciej Marian Giertych for 3 days, Roger Helmer for 3 days, Roger Knapman for 3 days, Hans-Peter Martin for 3 days and Philippe de Villiers for 3 days.
Vladimír Železný is reprimanded.
I hope that we shall not witness any further incidents similar to that which occurred here in the European Parliament on 12 December 2007. (Applause)
