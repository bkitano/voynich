Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2010 (debate) The next item is the report by Mr Ma≈àka, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2010.
I applaud his attempt to optimise the work of the European Parliament's administration, which is an institution employing 6 000 people.
Just over three years ago the institutions were using total space in excess of 2 million square metres.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, today we are deciding Parliament's budget for 2010 at a particularly crucial period in time which is defined, firstly, by what we all hope will be the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon; secondly, by the major economic crisis which has hit the European economy and, thirdly, by the new regulations for parliamentarians and parliamentary assistants.
I therefore believe that we are making a new start because, in the midst of the crisis, the European Parliament is setting a good example by keeping its expenditure for 2010 at very realistic, I would even say low levels.
As regards the three major multiannual programmes of Web TV, the Museum of European History and the Visitors' Centre in particular, we want express guarantees for their progress, so that the budget for 2010 can continue to support them, but always on the basis of a philosophy of proper, serious and assiduous control.
Firstly, we should support the proposal of the rapporteur to adopt for the present the draft of Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for 2010 in the form adopted by the Bureau of the European Parliament in April this year.
Meanwhile in the preparations for the 2010 budget we are seeing the greatest changes to European Parliament structures in the last 10 to 12 years.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 5 May 2009.
