Commemoration of deportations in 1941 in the Baltic States Ladies and gentlemen, this month sees the 70th anniversary of mass deportations carried out by the Soviet authorities from the Baltic States, which they had occupied since 1940.
I also wanted to remind you that 22 June, in two weeks' time, will be the 70th anniversary of the attack on the Soviet Union by Hitler's Germany.
Seventy years ago, about 50 000 Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian nationals were brutally deported from their homes in the Soviet-occupied Baltic States.
If we compare that figure of 50 000 out of the then 5.5 million population of the three Baltic States to that of the UK or France, the 50 000 Baltic deportees would have meant proportionately 432 000 citizens deported from the UK or 363 000 persons deported from France.
The 1941 deportations delivered a devastating blow to democratic civil society.
Therefore, the remembrance, 70 years later, of the Baltic deportations is an opportunity for a deepened understanding that your past is our past and vice versa.
The full knowledge of the 1941 crimes against humanity should become an integral part of our common European history.
They are still just as valid today and the best response to them is a united Europe. (Applause) Mr President, the deportations of residents of the Baltic countries in 1941 was one of the most dramatic and tragic events of the 20th century.
This isolation only ended in 1991 when it finally became possible to talk about the watershed in the history of the Baltic nations.
However, it was 2004 - the year of the Baltic countries' accession to the European Union - that really marked the end of the division of Europe.
Mr President, although the deportations in the Baltic states on 14 June 1941 and the second wave of deportations in March 1949 led to the subjugation of thousands of innocent people to many years of humiliation in Siberia and in death camps, Europe and world public opinion have not yet, to this day, recognised this fact.
More than 65 years have passed since the Second World War.
Just as they did in Belarus, the Soviets soon planned the deportation of the leading sections of society in the Baltic States, and the first mass deportations took place during the night of 13 to 14 June.
In Estonia, 14 June is a national day of commemoration.
In Europe and around the world, 14 June draws attention to the often forgotten suffering of small states and peoples, particularly in the former Soviet Union.
