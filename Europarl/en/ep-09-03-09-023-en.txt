rapporteur. - (RO) I would first of all like to thank the European Commission for this welcome initiative of the Green Paper on agricultural product quality and for the consultation launched on this topic.
The European policy on the quality of agricultural products represents a major issue for farmers, those involved in the food chain in general and, of course, consumers.
These discussions are in addition to the 560 contributions received during the consultation period introduced to help the Commission to define the strategic directions which are to be published in a communication scheduled for the end of May this year.
in writing. - (FR) The consumer is increasingly demanding with regard to the quality, origin and safety of agricultural products.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, quality is a key word throughout the entire food production chain, namely 'from field to table'.
The Lesser Poland and Kielce regions of Poland are still waiting for registration of products such as fasola korczyńska (the Korczyn bean), kiełbasa lisiecka (Lisiecka sausage), wiśnia nadwiślanka (the Vistula region cherry), śliwka szydłowska (the Szydlow plum), jabłka łąckie (the Łącko apple), obwarzanek krakowski (the Cracow bagel) and fasola z Doliny Dunajca (the Danube Valley bean).
