Welcome Now I would like to extend a warm welcome to two guests who are with us today from Belarus: Mrs Borys, President of the Union of Poles in Belarus, and Mr Milinkevich, winner of our own Sakharov Prize in 2006 and leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus. (Sustained applause) Unfortunately, Belarus has again found itself in the headlines over the persecution of non-governmental organisations.
