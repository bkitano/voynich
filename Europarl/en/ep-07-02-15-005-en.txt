We have already identified stock lending as something we should look at more closely in the context of the future Commission recommendation on shareholders' rights.
Thanks to the peculiarities of the bodies of company and civil law of the 27 Member States, and also cultural differences - some of them major - the negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council were protracted and difficult and ultimately produced only minimum harmonisation.
However, from a legal point of view its treatment is slightly different from the approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where strong opinion found in favour of certain key issues, in particular necessary distinctions required in dealing with intermediaries and stock lending when, in particular, shares were repatriated in order to allow for owners to vote.
I hope that we will still have this opportunity and that the Committee on Legal Affairs will also support us in having this further debate with Commissioner McCreevy.
The debate is closed.
