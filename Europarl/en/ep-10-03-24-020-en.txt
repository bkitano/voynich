In 2008, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported around 83 000 cases and close to 6 000 deaths due to tuberculosis in the European Union and EFTA countries.
This amounts to about 16 deaths a day.
Since 2002, more than EUR 124 million has been allocated to these efforts.
The main channel for financing this support is the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, to which the Commission has contributed EUR 870 million since 2002, with an annual contribution that amounts to EUR 100 million since 2008.
Globally, there were 9.4 million new cases of tuberculosis in 2008 and 1.8 million deaths.
However, as the Commission pointed out, people in Europe are also dying of tuberculosis.
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Member States to join forces and ramp up the fight against tuberculosis in order to succeed in controlling and eradicating this disease. (LT) We must combat tuberculosis, since every year, many people in the world die from this disease and almost one in three inhabitants of the world are infected by it.
Parliament's contribution and support is essential in contributing to our endeavours in fighting this disease within the European Union as well as in other countries.
