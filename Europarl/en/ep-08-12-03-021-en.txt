Implementation of REACH (debate) The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the pre-registration of phase-in substances according to the REACH Regulation - (B6-0490/2008).
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not take up a great deal of your time because this is a well-known topic.
author. - Madam President, like Guido Sacconi I can be fairly concise about this.
That is why we brought in the pre-registration process and, subsequently, the authorisation process.
I can tell you that, on 1 December, when the process closed, that figure was over 2 million.
The pre-registration period stipulated in the REACH Regulation began on 1 June 2008 and ended on 1 December 2008, in other words six months later.
In adopting the regulation we had assumed that we would have to reckon on the registration of approximately 200 000 chemical substances.
In actual fact, by the end of the pre-registration period there had been precisely 2 236 625 registrations.
According to the REACH Regulation, it was the task of the agency in Helsinki to establish the format for pre-registration and to make it freely available on its website.
The REACH IT system and the corresponding format for pre-registration of the substances concerned was available to companies on time on 1 June of this year.
In view of the rapid increase in pre-registration figures in recent weeks - up to 100 000 pre-registrations on a single day at times - the agency has taken additional technical measures and expanded its capacity.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Madam President, I want to thank the Commissioner for his answer.
After all, despite everything 2.2 million people have succeeded in registering - and from 65 000 different businesses, as Mr Bowis said.
There are just 15 at present, when we have 27 PBTs and 800 other chemicals that should already be included here.
