Parliament has great difficulties in getting a final picture, particularly in the case of the annual summaries and management declarations at national level, which the Commission presented to us for the first time on 15 February 2008, as the documents do not keep to uniform criteria.
In this context, the Commission feels that the statement of assurance issued by the Court of Auditors for 2007 is the best that has ever been obtained.
I am pleased to tell you that the Commission brought forward to 3 February the adoption of its latest report on the progress achieved.
Our communication of 3 February presents an initial assessment of the impact of the action plan as of 31 December 2008.
In comparison, the amount recovered in 2007 was 288 million.
I thank Mrs Stauner for her report, which is a call to improve our accounting framework still further.
