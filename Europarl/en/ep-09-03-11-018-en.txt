When we adopted this legislation, we did not decide on a clear and binding end date for migration to the SEPA instruments.
However, this is a legal matter for national authorities to solve, for example, by using the opportunity provided by the Payment Services Directive's implementation.
On 19 December 2007, the Commission decided that the MasterCard MIFs for cross-border card payments with MasterCard and Maestro branded consumer credit and debit cards were not compatible with the competition rules.
The Commission seeks to maintain a level playing field for MasterCard and Visa Europe as well as for the other payment card schemes which might emerge in the future.
SEPA is an integrated market for payment services in euros where there will be no difference between cross-border payments and national payments.
As you said, the Commission has committed itself to ensuring that migration to the SEPA instruments does not result in a more expensive payment system for the citizens of the European Union.
This date must not be later than 31 December 2012, after which date all payments in euros should be made using the SEPA standards.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 12 March 2009.
