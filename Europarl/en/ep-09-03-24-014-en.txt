author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are discussing is very clear and straightforward: there are approximately 500 million mobile telephones in use in Europe and 30 different types of charger.
As you perhaps already know, at their most recent congress in Barcelona the network operators announced that from 2012 onwards it will be possible to charge the majority of the new mobile phones that they sell with a single standardised charger.
It is also important for us to introduce a legal requirement for an automatic cut-off, so that the charger automatically switches off when the device is charged.
I also believe that it is important for a customer information campaign to be launched about the type of chargers for mobile phones. 2012 is not far away.
What is more, research shows that consumers spend EUR 300 million a year on new chargers because they are automatically included with the purchase of new phones.
The result of this is that there, too, the environment is also burdened to the tune of EUR 300 million a year, and that is without mentioning the waste of energy that these cheap chargers cause, as they are often left in the socket even after the phone itself has been disconnected, where they continue to consume energy.
I believe that this example also applies to the industry, as, if the industry has to resolve the issue itself, it will make a better job of it than if the solution is laid down by politicians.
If a family goes away for a weekend, it might take 30 chargers with it.
I hope that this really happens in 2012 and I hope that you act strongly if the industry does not live up to its commitments, as that is very important.
USB 2 ports can transfer not only energy but also data.
