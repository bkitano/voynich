Generalised tariff preferences (debate) The next item is the report by Mr Scholz, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 - C7-0135/2010 - 2010/140(COD)).
The deadline for this proposal was 1 June 2010.
It is also our obligation to make sure that the reduction in tariffs brings about a genuine improvement in the situation of the developing countries.
At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that Omnibus 2 must be tabled urgently.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I warmly acknowledge the support within the Committee on International Trade for the proposal on the extension of the regulation applying the scheme of generalised tariff preferences.
The European Parliament's support as expressed in the INTA Committee's vote on 3 March paves the way for successful continuity of the current scheme to the benefit of developing countries and the EU.
This is indeed crucial in order for Parliament to be able play its role in trade policy effectively.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the few methods of differentiation that works in favour of developing countries in international trade.
Until now, even on the basis of the pre-Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has not always been fully involved in decisions, as happened at the time of the discussions on Colombia or Sri Lanka that fired the enthusiasm of this House.
