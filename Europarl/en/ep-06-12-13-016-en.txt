Those six months have shown that there is a genuine understanding of what Parliament, the Council and the Commission can offer Europe when they work together.
The results are there to see: an agreement on sensitive issues, such as REACH, the adoption of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund - I am particularly proud of that because, as you know, it was a Commission initiative - a rapid reaction to the Lebanese crisis, the smooth preparation for Bulgaria's and Romania's accession - sensitive subject that it is! - and efforts to make the Union's external policy more coherent.
Admittedly, we need to make more effort at national level, but we also need to seize the opportunity to make the very most of the European dimension.
It is true that we still have problems in this area, but I believe that the approach that we have, the global approach that the Commission has formulated, may be the solution for Europe.
The benefits of the 2004 enlargement are clear to the Europe of 25.
We may well be free to do as we please on this earth, but, if our climate changes in a way that imperils us and impoverishes large areas, then our political efforts will avail us nothing; it is for that reason that this House and the other institutions must make climate change a priority issue.
I hope that Mr Erdogan will think again, but, generally speaking, this prospect of accession is indispensable in terms of Europe's security.
