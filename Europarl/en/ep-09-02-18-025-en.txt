We recognise that the EU needs a strategy on children.
The first step was the Commission communication 'Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child' in 2006.
This was followed in 2008 by the communication package on children in external actions, which outlined a comprehensive approach to children by the EU using all available instruments in external cooperation.
The idea of using 2009 for consultations was launched in the Commission itself and we are working to put in place the conditions for a process of consultation with children that avails itself of all existing tools.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 February 2009.
The Committee on Development adopted this own-initiative report (drafted by Glenys Kinnock (PES, UK) on a special place of children in EU external action in response to the Commission communication on the subject.
