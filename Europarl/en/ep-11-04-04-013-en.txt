Firstly, the Committee on Budgets has done its job and brought the draft estimate of Parliament's 2012 budget to the point where it can be examined, debated and voted on by your Parliament, by the House, in accordance with our procedures and with what we did last year.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a debate be held on the situation concerning Ai Weiwei in China, and that it be included in the debates held pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure on Thursday afternoon, instead of the debate on Zimbabwe previously intended for this time.
We will have the discussion on Mr Ai Weiwei and China on Thursday afternoon, and the discussion on Ivory Coast will take place at about 8 p.m.
Mrs in 't Veld, we will look into this and send you the information.
